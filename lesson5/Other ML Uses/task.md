# Other ML Uses

<b>1. </b> Clustering and predictions are far from the only things we can do with Machine Learning tools and methods.

Another nice use case is outlier detection in a text corpus: given a general way of framing things (say, a dataset 
of laws on the same subject), can we detect outliers or anomalies (for instance, a provision that is unique to a law) ?

<b>2. </b> Another neat implementation of machine learning, along the same logic, is to obtain "topics".
