 ANALYSIS: unpacking the recent annulment decision in SAUR v. Argentina

  reported recently
 </a>
 , an ad-hoc committee at the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) has dismissed the application by the Argentine Republic to annul a 2014 award in favor of French investor SAUR International S.A.
</p>
<p>
 Below, we delve deeper into the reasons that led the ad-hoc committee to reject Argentina’s bid in its entirety.
</p>
<p>
 Following SAUR’s claims that Argentina had failed to respect a 2007 settlement agreement between Argentina and OSM, in which SAUR held an indirect, minority stake, an ICSID tribunal composed of Christian Tomuschat, Bernard Hanotiau and Juan Fernández-Armesto, ruled in 2012 that Argentina was liable under the France-Argentina bilateral investment treaty (see our

 ), before awarding the investor more than $40 million in a final award in 2014 (analyzed in more depth

 </a>
 ).
</p>
<p>
 The award was challenged by Argentina under article 52 of the ICSID Convention, before an
 <em>
  ad-hoc
 </em>
 committee composed of

 </a>
 ,* current ICJ vice-president
 <a href="http://www.iareporter.com/arbitrator/Yusuf">

 </a>
 , and Álvaro Castellanos – but to no avail. In a decision dated December 19, 2016, and available for download in French (

 ) and in Spanish (

  here
 </a>
 ), the committee rejected Argentina’s bid to annul the award.
</p>
<p>
 Throughout its argument, detailed below, Argentina raised three of the five grounds for annulment available under the ICSID Convention,** arguing that in various parts of its decisions the tribunal breached fundamental rules of procedure, manifestly exceeded its powers, and/or failed to state the reasons for its conclusions – notably in contradicting itself at multiple times. (Strictly speaking, only a final award is subject to annulment under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, however the committee’s decision also analyzes preliminary rulings in the case, including a decision on jurisdiction and a decision on liability.)
</p>
<p>
 The law firm Shearman and Sterling represented SAUR, while Argentina was represented by its in-house legal team.
</p>
<p>
 This is the second success for SAUR before an ad-hoc committee this year, after a first committee refused in February to annul another, unrelated award in its favor, in a case where it was involved along with EDF International and León Participaciones Argentinas S.A. (see our analysis of this decision

 ). Earlier this month, Argentina also indicated that it has been successful in another arbitration involving a terminated water concession (

 </a>
 ).
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Ad hoc committee reaffirms narrow scope of annulment proceedings
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 In answer to Argentina’s contentions, the committee assessed the formal soundness of the tribunal’s reasoning, holding more than once that to second-guess its correctness was beyond the annulment’s scope of review. After endorsing the “point A to point B” test of the ad-hoc committee in
 <em>
  MINE v. Guinea
 </em>
 , the committee expressed in particular the view that “the tribunal’s job is not to convince Argentina that its analysis and its conclusions are correct. The tribunal is fully free in its reasoning, and it is free to choose the level of details it wishes to enter into in order to explain how it came to its conclusions.”
</p>
<p>
 The committee also insisted that it was beyond its power to review the tribunal’s evaluation of the evidence, or to substitute its own evaluation for that of the tribunal.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  The tribunal properly identified SAUR’s investment
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Argentina’s first ground for annulment concerned the nature of SAUR’s investment, an issue particularly contentious in the underlying arbitration. In particular, Argentina built its challenges on a finding by the tribunal that SAUR was not a party to a water concession contract between OSM and the Argentine province of Mendoza.
</p>
<p>
 In view of this clear holding, Argentina impugned the tribunal’s reasoning, claiming that it first based its jurisdiction over SAUR’s shares in OSM, and then decided the merits over the water concession contract. In finding that the state had expropriated this contract and should compensate SAUR for the loss, the tribunal allegedly dealt with two different investments/assets in different phases of the proceedings – and thus contradicted itself.
</p>
<p>
 The committee refused to read any such contradiction in the tribunal’s reasoning. It underlined that the tribunal focused at every juncture on SAUR’s stake in OSM. While the tribunal mentioned that, under the bilateral investment treaty, the concession contract could be a protected investment, the discussion regarding its expropriation ultimately concerned its effect on SAUR’s share in OSM: as the concession contract was OSM’s sole asset, its termination necessarily affected the value of SAUR’s 32.08% stake. As such, when read in context, the tribunal’s reasoning suffered no contradiction.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Argentina’s contention regarding “derivative actions” falls flat
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Argentina further attempted to challenge an alleged excess of powers by the tribunal, in allowing a “derivative action” to succeed. Relying on the award in
 <em>
  Poštová banka v. Greece
 </em>
 (
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/articles/sovereign-debt-arbitration-against-greece-is-dismissed-by-icsid-tribunal/">
  see here
 </a>
 ), Argentina advanced that SAUR was unable to claim on behalf of OSM with respect to the concession contract’s expropriation, and that, in finding such an expropriation, the tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction
 <em>
  ratione materiae
 </em>
 .
</p>
<p>
 This did not convince the committee, which noted that the tribunal, once again, only addressed SAUR’s claims regarding its stake in OSM. As such there was no “derivative action” to begin with, and no manifest excess of powers from the tribunal. In no weak terms, the committee concluded that Argentina’s argument was nothing but an attempt to “
 <em>
  analyze in details and
 </em>
 de novo
 <em>
  the debates on the jurisdiction
 </em>
 [of the tribunal]
 <em>
  in order to advance its cause concerning derivative actions in international law
 </em>
 ”.
</p>
<p>
 This is not the first time that Argentina makes this claim: earlier this year, another ad-hoc committee also composed of Álvaro Castellanos and Eduardo Zuleta dismissed in similar terms a similar contention when refusing to annul the award in
 <em>
  Total v. Argentina
 </em>
 (

 ).
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Committee dismissed Argentina’s illegality defence and its attempt to revise the tribunal’s decision
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 In the 2012 decision on jurisdiction and liability, the tribunal dismissed Argentina’s arguments regarding some payments OSM made to SAUR’s employees in Argentina, allegedly in a fraudulent manner. The tribunal relied, among other things, on the decision by Argentine court officials to dismiss a criminal case on this very issue, and endorsed SAUR’s interpretation of the factual record.
</p>
<p>
 Argentina later urged the tribunal to revise its ruling on the basis of a further decision by an Argentine court of appeal reinstating the criminal case. In an unpublished 2014 decision on revision, the tribunal declined to grant this request: it found that the new judgment by the court of appeal, which merely reinstated the case and ordered a new inquiry, would not change its findings on the alleged illegality.
</p>
<p>
 At the annulment phase, Argentina argued that the tribunal in its appreciation of the legality of SAUR’s investment manifestly exceeded its power, failed to state reasons, and gravely breached a rule of procedure by failing to consider certain elements of proof, such as this new decision.
</p>
<p>
 The committee disagreed and held that the tribunal properly evaluated the evidence presented by Argentina on this issue. Far from disregarding the decision of the court of appeal, it analyzed it and found it irrelevant. The committee concluded that Argentina was, again, seeking an impermissible de novo evaluation of the evidence.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  The type of expropriation was irrelevant for Argentina’s defense
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Argentina also took issue with how the tribunal dealt with the claim for expropriation, alleging that the pleadings concentrated exclusively on the existence of an
 <em>
  indirect
 </em>
 expropriation, while the tribunal eventually held that a
 <em>
  direct
 </em>
 expropriation took place. In Argentina’s view, this surprising finding proved to be not only beyond the scope of the proceedings, but also a fundamental breach of procedure, as its right to be heard on this issue has been infringed.
</p>
<p>
 On this point as well, the committee was unmoved. It stressed these contentions’ artificiality: irrespective of the qualification of the expropriation as direct or indirect, SAUR claimed that it had been illegally dispossessed of its investment in OSM, and Argentina answered that claim. The debate centered on the article of the treaty prohibiting expropriations, and Argentina had plenty of opportunity to argue its case on this point, and no breach of procedure thus occurred. In these circumstances the tribunal was free to adopt the qualification “direct expropriation”, and this choice was beyond the committee’s scope of review, especially given that the underlying decision was clearly and sufficiently reasoned.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Technical assistance contract was a protected investment and could be compensated
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 The stake in OSM was only one part of SAUR’s investment in this case: it also signed a technical assistance contract with OSM in relation to the water concession, under which it was promised a management fee. In its decision on damages, the tribunal held that the sums expected under this contract – which were not paid following the termination of the water concession contract – should be compensated.
</p>
<p>
 Argentina contested this whole part of the tribunal’s findings, arguing that the technical assistance contract was not a protected investment, and that the tribunal thus manifestly exceeded its powers by ruling in excess of its jurisdiction ratione materiae. The state also claimed that the tribunal’s reasoning was contradictory, notably where it both observed that SAUR hoped to disengage from OSM and this technical assistance contract in 2013, and yet held that this contract was to be performed until 2023 – and should thus be compensated on this basis.
</p>
<p>
 The committee acknowledged that the technical assistance contract had caused some controversy during the arbitration, but noticed that Argentina only contested SAUR’s claims in this respect as being brought too late, not as referring to something that was not a protected investment. In any case, the tribunal eventually accepted that the claim for money under the contract was a protected investment under the treaty. As such, the compensation eventually awarded was not contractual in nature, but the direct consequence of the loss of this contract following Argentina’s treaty breach.
</p>
<p>
 In the committee’s view, this interpretation was sound, and devoid of contradictions. In particular, the tribunal properly explained that SAUR’s hopes to walk away from its investment in OSM and from the technical assistance contract were the result of the very same actions attributable to Argentina, and as such were irrelevant for the assessment of damages.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  No contradiction in apportioning costs between the parties
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Argentina also attacked the tribunal’s reasoning on the apportionment of costs between the parties, finding it contradictory on at least two counts: because the tribunal held that SAUR prevailed on 100% of its claims, while it received only a quarter ($40 million) of the sums it claimed (more than $143 million), and because it held that Argentina was responsible for the length of the dispute, while finding that the settlement agreement had been entered in good faith by Argentina.
</p>
<p>
 In a few short lines, the committee dismissed these alleged contradictions as artificial. Firstly, SAUR indeed prevailed on 100% of its claims, if not on the quantum, which is a different issue. The tribunal also properly reasoned that it was Argentina’s failure to respect the settlement agreement that prolonged the dispute.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Argentina’s “counterclaims” were taken into account in the tribunal’s damages assessment
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 In its 2012 decision on jurisdiction and liability, the tribunal acknowledged that OSM failed to pay certain taxes and sums due to the state. In a still-unpublished 2012 Decision on Counterclaims, the tribunal however rejected Argentina’s request to designate a third expert to evaluate this prejudice, but allowed it to present it as a “counterclaim” in the damages phase of the dispute.
</p>
<p>
 Argentina claimed that the tribunal eventually failed to address these counterclaims in its final award, although these were substantial enough to deny SAUR any compensation.
</p>
<p>
 The committee was unimpressed by these contentions. It noted that the tribunal made sure that the diverse sums due by OSM to the government were considered in the assessment of the value of the investment, even though the tribunal did not discuss these as pertaining specifically to Argentina’s “counterclaim.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  The tribunal properly declined to reopen the case on the basis of “new evidence”
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Lastly, the decision on annulment also revealed that Argentina, in a rare move, requested the tribunal to reopen the case under article 38(2) of the Arbitration Rules. Argentina’s request followed a decision from the Argentine bankruptcy court that ruled on the amounts owed by the now-defunct OSM to its creditors. In Argentina’s contention, this decision was “new evidence” in the meaning of article 38(2), which required a new assessment of the damages owed by Argentina.
</p>
<p>
 In the still unpublished 2014 decision on reopening, the tribunal refused to grant this request, and held that these sums were in any event irrelevant for the damages’ assessment, insofar the ICSID and bankruptcy proceedings were totally distinct and had different purposes. The committee, in its turn, held that this reasoning was clear enough and that it properly dealt with Argentina’s request.
</p>
<p>
 Following what it accepted as a practice of leaving the costs of annulment proceedings to the parties, notwithstanding the results of the annulment, the ad-hoc committee ordered Argentina to pay the administrative costs and arbitrators’ fees.
