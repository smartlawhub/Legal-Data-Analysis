Annulment proceedings started in good faith   In seeking the lift of the stay on enforcement, the claimants contended that such stays are the exception to the general rule under the ICSID Convention. They also pointed to Bolivia’s public statements to the effect that it would not honour the award, and the alleged bad faith and dilatory nature of these annulment proceedings.  Bolivia countered that the referenced public statements dated from before the date of the award, and were contradicted by more recent statements pledging to honour Bolivia’s international obligations. Far from being brought in bad faith, the state also argued that its request for annulment stemmed from serious flaws in the award, some of them flagged by the dissenting arbitrator (we covered that dissent here ).  Ultimately, the ad-hoc committee agreed that Bolivia’s apparent attitude towards compliance has evolved over time, and further noted that its request for annulment (signed by some of Bolivia’s higher authorities) pledged to respect the award in categorical terms. In addition, the committee found that Bolivia’s annulment claims were, as a matter of first impression, serious enough, and thus not seemingly dilatory and bad faith tactics.
