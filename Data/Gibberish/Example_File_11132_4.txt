Argentina’s contention regarding “derivative actions” falls flat   Argentina further attempted to challenge an alleged excess of powers by the tribunal, in allowing a “derivative action” to succeed. Relying on the award in Poštová banka v. Greece ( see here ), Argentina advanced that SAUR was unable to claim on behalf of OSM with respect to the concession contract’s expropriation, and that, in finding such an expropriation, the tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction ratione materiae .  This did not convince the committee, which noted that the tribunal, once again, only addressed SAUR’s claims regarding its stake in OSM. As such there was no “derivative action” to begin with, and no manifest excess of powers from the tribunal. In no weak terms, the committee concluded that Argentina’s argument was nothing but an attempt to “ analyze in details and de novo the debates on the jurisdiction [of the tribunal] in order to advance its cause concerning derivative actions in international law ”.  This is not the first time that Argentina makes this claim: earlier this year, another ad-hoc committee also composed of Álvaro Castellanos and Eduardo Zuleta dismissed in similar terms a similar contention when refusing to annul the award in Total v. Argentina ( see here ).
