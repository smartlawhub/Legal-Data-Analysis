MFN can’t be used to avoid temporal limitations   Both preliminary objections also met a common counter-argument from the claimant: that the temporal limitations of the Spain-Mexico BIT could be avoided by way of its Most Favoured Nation (MFN) clause.  The tribunal dismissed this argument, finding that the case fell within the limits of MFN clauses contemplated by the Maffezini v. Spain tribunal. For the Tecmed tribunal, the treaty’s temporal application (regarding both acts prior to conclusion and the three-year time limit for claims) was one of the “determining factors for [the contracting parties’] acceptance” that the Maffezini tribunal thought should not be overridden via MFN.  As such, the Tecmed tribunal provided an addition to the four exceptions explicitly identified by the Maffezini tribunal , further narrowing the scope of MFN clauses, but without explicitly challenging that tribunal’s findings.
