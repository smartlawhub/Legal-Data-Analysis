Investments steered, in part, by political considerations are not excluded from BIT’s scope   The tribunal also dismissed Ukraine’s argument that Tatneft’s investment in Ukrtatnafta did not qualify as an investment under the BIT because the contributions to Ukrtatnafta had been decided at the political level in the framework of the Treaty.  The tribunal refused to read additional requirements into the BIT’s definition of investment, or to enter into an examination of the motives of the investment. In any case, the award adopted the claimant’s view that the investment had both public and private purposes. This could be, again, attributed to the “the transition period between the command economies of the past and the market economies of the present.”  Ultimately, Tatneft’s interest and activities with respect to Ukrtatnafta were, “in their essence, commercially-oriented.” This was enough to qualify as an investment under the BIT.
