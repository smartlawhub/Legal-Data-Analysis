Contractual breaches, on their own, are not an expropriation   In a last step, the tribunal considered whether Mexico expropriated Waste Management’s investment. This claim had two aspects: that the conduct of Acapulco resulted in a “creeping expropriation” which rendered valueless Acaverde’s concession; and that its contractual rights were virtually expropriated due Acapulco’s failure to pay.  Despite reviewing the case law on this point, the tribunal held that it was unnecessary to reach a final decision on the meaning of “tantamount to expropriation” (and in particular, on whether the Metalclad award’s interpretation – discussed here – was too broad): no expropriation could be discerned in this case.  On the first aspect, the tribunal observed that at every moment Acaverde had control and use of its property. The tribunal stressed that “an enterprise is not expropriated just because its debts are not paid or other contractual obligations towards it are breached.”  Further, and given the distinction between contractual breaches and treaty breaches (see below), the claimant had to “show an effective repudiation of [its] right, unredressed by any remedies available […], which has the effect of preventing its exercise entirely or to a substantial extent.” The claimant failed to do so. Insofar as Acaverde had judicial redress available, Acapulco’s failures to perform could not be qualified as an expropriation.
