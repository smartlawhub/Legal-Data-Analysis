Proceedings are also inadmissible due to abuse of rights   One last additional basis prompted the tribunal to declare the claims inadmissible: in the view of the tribunal, Mr Sawiris’ decision to file multiple notices of dispute at different levels of the chain of ownership constituted an abuse of rights.  The tribunal acknowledged that abuses of rights in investment arbitration had been found in different circumstances, most often where an investor restructured an investment post-dispute to benefit from the dispute resolution provisions of a favourable investment agreement (see, e.g., Philip Morris v. Australia ).  However, for the tribunal, the notion could capture other circumstances, such as those of the present case.** In the tribunal’s view, “the purpose of investment treaties” was best accomplished when only one investor in a chain of ownership brought a claim against a respondent state, and possibly undermined when several investors brought claims for the same harm, due to the risk of conflicting decisions and double recoveries. The tribunal observed that Mr Sawiris had himself confessed that the three notices of dispute had been sent for strategic reasons.  (The tribunal here also cited RSM v. Grenada as a further instance of abusive claims by multiple levels of a chain of ownership. This scenario, involving 100% ownership at each level, was recently distinguished by the Eskosol v. Italy tribunal ( see here ) from the scenario in that case, where a prior claim by a parent company which owned only 80% of Eskosol could not prevent Eskosol’s own claim from proceeding.)  As OTMTI’s claim was an abuse of “the system of investment protection,” the tribunal found it inadmissible.  Given the respondent’s partial success in the arbitration, the claimant was ordered to shoulder the arbitration costs and 50% of Algeria’s legal costs.
