After importing full protection and security clause into treaty, tribunal favours a broad construction of this particular obligation   Ukraine also breached the full protection and security (FPS) standard, similarly imported via MFN from the UK-Ukraine BIT, in failing to prevent the forceful take-over of the refinery.  The tribunal acknowledged disagreements over whether FPS covers only physical protection (as held in Saluka v. Czech Republic ), or constitutes a more general legal protection (as held, e.g., in Renée Rose Levy v. Peru ).  The tribunal inclined to the broad interpretation, notably because article 2(2) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT also provided for “complete and unconditional legal protection” in accordance with Ukraine’s legislation.  Besides, the conjunction of FPS and FET in the same sentence in the UK-Ukraine BIT testified to the “close relationship” between the two standards. Accordingly, the tribunal found that the failings of the Ukrainian legal system (and of the Prosecutor) had been already properly looked at in the context of the FET standard.  Nevertheless, the tribunal was satisfied that Ukraine had also failed to comply with FPS in its narrower “physical security” sense, given its failure to prevent the refinery’s take-over. The presence of government troops at the refinery following the take-over was particularly damnable, and Ukraine’s explanation (that these troops were acting as a private security force) lacked credibility, the tribunal said.
