Familiar EU law controversies make appearance in dispute thanks to brief from the European Commission   Spain’s first jurisdictional objection pertained to the relationship between the ECT and the legal order of the European Union. The state relied in particular on an amicus curiae submitted by the European Commission.  The Commission reiterated before the tribunal the now familiar (see here ) “implicit disconnection” argument: that the ECT does not allow for the arbitration of disputes concerning two EU member states.  In addition, the investor-state dispute mechanism as provided in the ECT breaches the EU treaties, the Commission said, as the latter reserve disputes over EU law to the jurisdiction of European courts. Among other things, Spain cited in support of this thesis the Commission’s infringement proceedings against Member States over the termination of intra-EU BITs (see here ).  While the tribunal considered these objections “of great importance,” and reviewed them with “the highest attention,” it was ultimately unmoved.
