ANALYSIS: Enforcement of controversial ICSID award against Romania is stayed by UK judge pending EU Court decision, but investors may get security from Romania in interim    In a judgment dated January 20, 2017 Mr Justice Blair of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales has ordered a stay of the enforcement of the ICSID award in the case of Micula and others v. Romania.*  The development has been noted in recent days on several legal blogs, including that of Brick Court Chambers – whose barristers were involved in the case. Below, we offer our own in-depth report on the judgment (a copy of which is available here ),  This development in the UK courts is the latest episode in a string of contentious enforcement proceedings opposing not only the Swedish Micula brothers and Romania, but also the European Commission. In the Commission’s view, the ICSID tribunal of Laurent Levy (presiding), Stanimir Alexandrov, and Georges Abi-Saab erred in deciding in favour of the claimants in 2013, as the compensation awarded to them amounts to new state aid, unlawful under European Union law (we reported on the ICSID award here ).  Following a state aid investigation, the Commission’s opinion was made official in a Final Decision dated March 30, 2015, which enjoined Romania from honouring the award (see here ). The investors are currently seeking to annul this Final Decision before the General Court of the European Union (GCEU).
