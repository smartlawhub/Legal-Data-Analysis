Tribunal expounds on the nature of the trust   Further, the tribunal stressed that the Qatar Trust itself had no legal personality. The tribunal found support in the precedent of Renta 4 v Russia , were a tribunal declined jurisdiction over certain Spanish investment funds, which displayed “great similarities with a trust.”  The parties also apparently debated at length whether the Qatar Trust was a beneficiary trust (i.e., set up for the benefit of an identifiable beneficiary) or a purpose trust (i.e., whose raison d’être is in pursuing a specific purpose). The tribunal ultimately found that it was a beneficiary trust.  Indeed, the tribunal agreed with Venezuela that Blue Bank had limited powers as a trustee, and was largely subjected to the decisions of the beneficiary – the “real” and ultimate owner of the trust’s assets. For two of the arbitrators – Mr Bermann and Ms Malintoppi – this reinforced the earlier conclusion that the tribunal lacked jurisdiction over the case.*
