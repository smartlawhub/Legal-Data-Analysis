Tribunal sees court judgments as annihilating Tatneft’s stake in Ukrtatnafta   This however was only one part of the “corporate struggle” designed to put control of Ukrtatnafta in other hands.  Soon after Mr Ovcharenko’s reinstatement as Chairman, Tatneft and the other Tatarstan shareholders found themselves embroiled in legal disputes based on the alleged invalidity of their shareholding. These ultimately led to the loss of Tatneft shares in Ukrtatnafta.  In a first step, a Ukrainian Prosecutor argued before the Kyiv Economic Court that the resolutions that had originally endorsed the Tatarstan side’s contribution to the joint-venture were invalid, because Tatarstan and Tatneft failed to contribute oil-related assets as originally contemplated under Ukrtatnafta’s founding treaty. Korsan (the supposed stalking-horse for the Privat Group) joined and supported the Prosecutor’s claim in that case. This legal manoeuver prevailed in the first instance proceedings.  On this basis, and in a second step, Ukrtatnafta, now controlled by Mr Ovcharenko, initiated proceedings before the Economic Court of the Poltava Region seeking to invalidate Tatneft’s purchase of shares in Ukrtatnafta.**  Although Tatneft’s purchase of shares as well as the aforementioned shareholders’ resolutions dated back a decade, apparently falling well outside a three-year domestic statute of limitations, both the Kyiv and Poltava courts decided to renew the limitation period in these two cases.  The Kyiv court held that the three-year limitations period could be renewed because the Prosecutor had only been made aware of the Tatarstan side’s violations in 2007. Meanwhile, the Poltava court discarded the limitations period on the grounds that Ukrtatnafta could not have brought its claim until the Kyiv court had ruled on invalidating the original shareholders’ resolutions.
