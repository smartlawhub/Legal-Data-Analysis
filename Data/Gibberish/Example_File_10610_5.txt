Tribunal  sees no conflict between the ECT and the EU legal order   As a second step, the tribunal dismissed the argument that the ECT’s provisions, including its dispute-settlement mechanism, contravened the European legal order.  Indeed, the tribunal noted that any incompatibility between the two legal orders would not pertain to its jurisdiction, but would need to be decided as a conflict-of-law question, which the tribunal would be competent to resolve.  In addition (and “ex abundanti cautela”), the tribunal cited the findings of the Electrabel tribunal (see here ) to the effect that the circumstances of the ECT’s conclusion generates a presumption that both legal regimes are compatible.  The only potential remaining stumbling block to the tribunal’s jurisdiction was then the alleged monopoly of EU courts’ over the interpretation of EU law, under article 344 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  However, the tribunal noted, article 344 concerns only the EU treaties – not the ECT. Besides, in practice, courts and tribunals daily interpret or even apply EU law, as directed by the EU courts themselves. As a result, the potential implications of this dispute over EU law did not bar the tribunal’s jurisdiction.
