The big picture: where this decision fits within the context of other similar cases filed after Venezuela gave notice of its denunciation   The tribunal’s decision is consistent with the Venoklim award cited above, but also the Rusoro v Venezuela and Tenaris v Venezuela awards.  Out of the remaining five disputes filed in 2012 following Venezuela’s denunciation of the ICSID Convention, three are still pending a decision on jurisdiction. Jurisdictional hearings were held last year in the dispute between Barbados investor Transban Investments Corps and Venezuela, another dispute slowed down by challenges to the arbitrators. Challenges have been even fiercer (and one is ongoing at the moment) in the dispute between Owen-Illinois and Venezuela, which also held jurisdictional hearings last year. By contrast, financial issues have slowed the proceedings in Valle Verde v Venezuela , although jurisdictional hearings were eventually held in February of this year.  As for the two other cases, Saint-Gobain’s claim was filed and registered before July 2012, and Venezuela apparently did not contest jurisdiction; we recently reported on the liability award in this case (only the amount of damages remains to be decided). Finally, the Ternium v Venezuela dispute has been discontinued soon after it was registered.
