Overview: Kazakh investors clear jurisdictional hurdles in dispute with Uzbekistan, although further illegality issue looms at merits phase     As we reported recently , a tribunal reached a decision on jurisdiction on March 8, 2017 [ click to download ] in a dispute filed with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) nearly four years ago. The claimants, Vladislav Kim and eleven other individuals, are partners in a major Kazakh private equity fund, Visor Group.*  This decision opens the way for a hearing of the merits in a dispute over the claimants’ investments in two Uzbek cement production companies.  The tribunal was composed of Arbitrator 
   (chair), Arbitrator 
   (claimants’ appointee) and Arbitrator 
   (respondent’s appointee). The investors chose ICSID arbitration under the 1997 Kazakhstan-Uzbekistan bilateral investment treaty (BIT) (the treaty also provided for arbitration under UNCITRAL Rules, or – surprisingly in light of the seeming obstacle found in Article 34(1) of the ICJ Statute – for a referral of any investor-state dispute to the International Court of Justice).  The dispute was bifurcated in 2014, to review four of Uzbekistan’s five preliminary objections in an initial jurisdictional phase.  Below, we discuss the first two objections raised by Uzbekistan. We report on the third objection (an allegation that the claimants’ investment was made in breach of Uzbek laws) in a companion article . A fourth objection (an allegation that the claimants’ investment was tainted by corruption) is heard in the final part of our series of reports on this decision.  A fifth objection, which bears on allegations of continuing bribery of Uzbek officials during the operation of the investment, was joined to the merits.
