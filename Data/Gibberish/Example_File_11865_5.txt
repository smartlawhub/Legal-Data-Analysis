Disclosure application also rejected   Italy also asked the tribunal to direct the claimant to confirm it relies on a third-party funder, and, in the affirmative, to disclose “whether such third party would be financially sound as well as committed to execute a cost award.” Italy relied on the precedent in Muhammet Çap &amp; al. v Turkmenistan in making this request (see here ).  However, the tribunal found that this request was moot now that Eskosol has admitted the existence of litigation funding arrangements sufficient to cover any costs award at that point.  (The award does not record whether Italy also asked for disclosure of the funder’s name to verify the inexistence of conflicts of interests. This “transparency” motive for disclosure has previously found favour with the Muhammet Çap, EuroGas and South American Silver v Bolivia tribunals.)  The provisional measures request was thus dismissed, and costs reserved for later.
