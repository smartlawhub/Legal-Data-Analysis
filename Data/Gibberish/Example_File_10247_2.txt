English judge agrees with tribunal that there is no offer to arbitrate in the contract   In its bid to set aside the award, Ruby Roz put forward two arguments that had earlier failed to convince the arbitrators.  The first was that a 1999 contract with an instrumentality of Kazakhstan included an arbitration clause that gave the tribunal jurisdiction over the dispute. The clause provided that a dispute could be submitted “to various foreign arbitral bodies, if the interests of a foreign Investor are affected and there is a written objection by such foreign Investor to the dispute being heard in Kazakhstani courts.”  The arbitrators had focused on the term “foreign Investor” and found that Ruby Roz, although owned from 2004 by Lebanese businessman Mr Kassem Omar, was not a “foreign investor” in the plain meaning of the contract since it was incorporated in Kazakhstan.  Ruby Roz relied on several external sources, such as the Foreign Investment Law, to argue that this contractual term should receive a broader interpretation.  This did not convince Mr Justice Knowles, who, “reluctant to look beyond the Contract”, did not find that any of Ruby Roz’s arguments had the effect of broadening the interpretation of “foreign Investor” to include local entities.
