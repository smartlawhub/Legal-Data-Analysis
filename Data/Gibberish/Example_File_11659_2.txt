No excess of power by the tribunal in upholding jurisdiction over the case   In seeking to set aside the award, Venezuela first alleged that the tribunal exceeded its powers. Two findings from the tribunal were singled out as constituting such an excess: its decision to uphold jurisdiction over the claim (whereas Venezuela had argued that the dispute was contractual in nature and did not fall under the BIT); and its choice of a valuation method allegedly used in contradiction with the BIT.  With respect to the tribunal’s jurisdictional findings, Venezuela argued that the district court’s review of the tribunal’s findings should be de novo and not deferential (citing, in particular, the position of the Restatement (Third) of the US Law of International Commercial Arbitration on this issue). The district court however disagreed. In the court’s view, the case law on that point indicated that the standard of review should be deferential where the arbitration rules explicitly provide for the tribunal’s power to review its own jurisdiction.  Not that it mattered here: the district court found that under any standard, Venezuela’s argument would fail. Indeed, the tribunal had already rejected Venezuela’s claims that the claimant had sought to dress up mere contract claims as breaches of the treaty. In the tribunal’s view, Crystallex’s claims went further than mere contractual breaches, as the investor had also challenged sovereign activity by the Venezuelan state and its instrumentalities. The district court found no fault with this analysis.
