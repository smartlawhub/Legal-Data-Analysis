In any case, OTMTI’s “effective seat” was in Luxembourg   The tribunal added, however, that even if the claimant’s nationality had to be assessed on the basis of Luxembourg law, which assigns corporate nationality in terms of the “siège réel” (or place of “central administration,” i.e., effective seat), the claimant would satisfy the jurisdictional requirements ratione personae .  Indeed, the tribunal observed, Luxembourg law mainly relied on formal factors in its assessment of a company’s place of “central administration.” Since OTMTI was registered in Luxembourg, had its shareholders and board meetings and kept its corporate and accounting records there, it would be Luxembourgish under Luxembourg laws, and accordingly a “national of a Contracting party” under the ICSID Convention.  The tribunal also cited with approval a statement of the first Tenaris and Talta tribunal according to which the nature of the corporation (as a holding company not charged with much operational work) was relevant for this assessment (a finding shared by the second Tenaris and Talta tribunal, as reported here ).
