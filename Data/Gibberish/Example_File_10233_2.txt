High Court declines to set aside the award’s registration, as it is distinct from its enforcement   The High Court judgment was prompted by a challenge from Romania (supported by the European Commission) to the registration of the award under the UK’s Arbitration (International Investment Disputes) Act 1966, which encapsulates the UK’s obligation under the ICSID Convention. The investors were granted their initial registration of the award in 2014.  Romania and the Commission later moved to set aside the registration of the award, arguing that the award’s enforcement would conflict with the Commission’s Final Decision and contrary to** the principle of sincere cooperation under article 4(3) of the Treaty on European Union, which “precludes national courts from taking decisions which conflict with a decision of the Commission”.  This did not convince Mr Justice Blair, who refused to set aside the award’s registration order. He noted that registration did not amount to enforcement, and only the latter could potentially conflict with the Commission’s Final Decision. In addition, under the 1966 Act, the claimants were entitled to this registration. As the Commission’s order was directed to Romania only, it did not prevent the investors from seeking this registration.
