ANALYSIS: Orascom’s claims stumble on earlier case settled by third party, as well as on its own abuse of rights    As we report in a companion article , a trio of arbitrators ( Arbitrator 
   , Arbitrator 
   and Arbitrator 
   ) recently dismissed the claims of Luxembourg-based Orascom TMT Investments Sàrl (OTMTI) against Algeria in a dispute related to local telecoms company Djezzy. OTMTI is owned and controlled by Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris, who successfully turned Djezzy into the main Algerian mobile network operator in the 2000s, before selling its stake to the Russian VimpelCom in 2011.  Although the claimant emerged victorious from Algeria’s jurisdictional objections ratione materiae et personae , the case hit a wall when the tribunal examined a set of further objections that pertained to admissibility or jurisdiction and ultimately found enough merit in some of these to derail OTMTI’s claims.
