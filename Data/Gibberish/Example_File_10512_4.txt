Tribunal declines claimant’s request for an anti-suit injunction to restrain Ghana’s pursuit of local claims – but refuses halt its own proceedings in deference to local injunction   Notwithstanding the injunctive order from the Ghana High Court and the state’s request to suspend the arbitral proceedings, the arbitrators elected to proceed with the October 2010 hearing on jurisdiction. Then, the claimant sought an anti-suit injunction from the tribunal, in a bid to prevent Ghana from pursuing its claims before the Ghanaian courts.  The tribunal issued an Interim Award on December 22, 2010 [ click to download ]. While professing the “highest respect for the courts of Ghana and its legal system,” and underlining the tribunal’s own “aim to seek the most reasonable alternative in the pursuit of justice,” the tribunal noted that it was not bound by the order of the Ghana High Court, nor did the latter question the tribunal’s competence to rule on Ghana’s objections under the UNCITRAL rules. “In the same spirit of courtesy and respect,” the tribunal thus denied the claimant’s request for an anti-suit injunction.
