Algeria contests the genuineness of OTMTI’s siège social   As a first step, the tribunal had to examine the meaning of the term “siège social” in the French-language Algeria-BLEU BIT’s definition of an “investor,” which includes “any legal person constituted in accordance with Belgian, Luxembourg or Algerian legislation and having its registered office [ siège social ] in the territory of Belgium, Luxembourg or Algeria.” (This English text is based on an unofficial translation of the BIT filed with the UN.) This was essential for the tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione personae over OTMTI.  Algeria interpreted “siège social” as different from “statutory seat,” and proposed that it referred instead to the “real seat,” the place or effective management – “the heart and the brain” – of the company’s operations. For Algeria, there was no doubt that OTMTI’s real seat was in Egypt, where Mr Sawiris and his team lived and worked, while the activity of the Management Board in Luxembourg had no real bearing on the company’s management.  In particular, the parties sparred over the findings of the tribunal in the first Tenaris and Talta v. Venezuela case over the meaning of “siège social” in a similarly-worded Luxembourg BIT (see here ), after the tribunal sought specific comments on the award. While Algeria endorsed this precedent, OTMTI found its findings on the award’s interpretation of siège social “erroneous.” (The award in the second Tenaris and Talta case, which we reviewed here , was issued after the OTMTI tribunal closed its proceedings, but came to the same conclusions as the first tribunal on this point.)
