Tribunal lays out a test of prima facie jurisdiction   The above considerations left open the question of whether the claimant had no genuine treaty claim distinct from its contract claims. For the state, it did not suffice for an investor to present essentially-contractual claims as claims for breach of the treaty.  While the tribunal agreed with the latter proposition, it stressed that it should nonetheless refrain from deciding the merits at the jurisdictional stage. Rather, citing precedents from the International Court of Justice and other investment tribunals (such as SGS v Philippines), the tribunal proposed the following test of its jurisdiction: the tribunal will have jurisdiction ratione materiae , and prima facie , if the facts as pleaded by the claimant – assuming that they were true – would fall within the protection provided in the BIT.
