Investor succeeds in excluding certain evidence in Paris proceedings   As a preliminary aspect of the Paris proceedings, Mr Belokon asked the court to disregard some pieces of evidence introduced by the Kyrgyz Republic. Mr. Belokon contended that this evidence was illegally obtained by the Kyrgyz Republic during the criminal investigation, and as a result of the expropriation of Manas Bank.  Although the Court held that, where international public policy is concerned, it is justifiable to take into account evidence that was not available to the arbitral tribunal, nevertheless due process must be respected.  After noting that the Kyrgyz Republic did not deny that Mr Belokon had had no access to the prosecution’s evidence during the criminal inquiry, the Court accepted that this lack of due process warranted the exclusion of the challenged evidence.
