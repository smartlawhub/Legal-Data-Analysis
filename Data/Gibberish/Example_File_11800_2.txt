Claims are not time-barred by Venezuela’s denunciation of the ICSID Convention   In its first jurisdictional objection, Venezuela hoped to reap the benefits of its denunciation of the ICSID Convention in January 2012, which took effect six months later, on June 24, 2012.  Although the investors registered their claim with ICSID on June 20, 2012*** (one of the nine claims to be lodged following Venezuela’s denunciation, see here ), the state brought the tribunal’s attention to article 72 of the Convention, which provides that the denunciation’s notice “shall not affect the rights or obligations under this Convention of that State […] arising out of consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre given by one of them before” it is received by the Convention’s depositary.  For Venezuela, such “consent to jurisdiction” could only arise following the six-months mandatory negotiation period provided in the relevant BITs. With respect to Tenaris’ investment in Tavsa, Venezuela argued that the consent was never perfected, because Tenaris failed to negotiate in good faith.  Alternatively, Venezuela pointed to the fact that Tenaris’s offer to negotiate had reserved the investor’s right to seek arbitration even before the end of the six-months period, in the event that the negotiations appeared futile. This reservation, Venezuela argued, was inconsistent with the country’s offer to arbitrate contained in the BIT; thus, consent to jurisdiction was allegedly never perfected.  Both arguments were quickly dismissed by the tribunal, who found ample proof that Tenaris had complied with the negotiations requirement. Moreover, Tenaris’s reservation of rights did not complicate its acceptance of Venezuela’s offer to arbitrate. Indeed, the tribunal noted that such a reservation was consistent with a principle endorsed by prior tribunals: that investors need not pursue to their term futile negotiations. What’s more, Tenaris did not, in any event, make use of this reservation.
