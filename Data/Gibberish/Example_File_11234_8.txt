Evidence of discrimination with respect to “given identifiable interests”   Likewise, the tribunal noted that a finding of discrimination under the rubric of the FET clause was “unavoidable”. This case did not necessarily involve nationality-based discrimination, the tribunal explained, but discrimination towards “given identifiable interests” (here, the Tatarstan parties) as compared to other interests in the joint-venture.  “Particularly telling” were the Prosecutor’s actions to enforce a supposed “parity” requirement (between the Ukrainian and Tatarstan sides, under the Ukrtatnafta Treaty), “which was forgotten as soon as the Ukrainian-related interests took over the company […], as if the parity requirement no longer had any relevance.”
