Remoteness not a bar to jurisdiction; neither is Uzbekistan’s lack of awareness of the investment   Uzbekistan also argued that the BIT did not protect indirect investments, and that the claimants were too remote from the investment, due to the multi-layered corporate structure that held the investment (a claim typically rejected in investment jurisprudence; see, e.g., Flemingo v Poland .) Uzbekistan also contended that the claimants’ shares held through the Cypriot trusts were not protected, as the BIT protects only legal (as opposed to beneficial) ownership.  However, the tribunal refused to read these limitations into the text of the treaty.  The state had found alleged support for the remoteness proposition in awards such as in Enron v Argentina and Société Générale v Dominican Republic (see here ). On the basis of the same awards, Uzbekistan also derived an “awareness requirement”: investments should not be protected under the BIT if the state was not aware of it.  However, the tribunal was not convinced that such “awareness requirement” existed. On the contrary, such a requirement was inconsistent with the “objects [sic] and purpose of international investment law”. (The tribunal was not speaking here of the narrow object and purpose of the relevant BIT, but did not elaborate as to the perceived objects and purposes of “investment law” as a body of law.)
