Which law controls the case need not be decided as claimant’s petition fails even under more favourable law   The parties sparred over the choice of law applicable to the set aside proceedings. Although Mesa Power petitioned the DC Court, the seat of the arbitration had been Miami, Florida. For Canada, this meant that the case law of the 11 th Circuit, and not that of the DC Circuit, should govern the set aside proceedings.  This choice-of-law issue had great importance, notably because the 11 th Circuit recognises fewer grounds to set aside international arbitration awards. In particular, the 11 th Circuit denies that “manifest disregard of the law” can be a basis for set-aside, whereas Mesa Power’s petition before the DC Court was partly based on this ground.  The DC Court, however, found Canada’s argument in this respect unconvincing, and saw analogies with the situation where a case is transferred from one federal circuit to another. In the latter case, the law of the circuit which receives the case governs – which would point, here, to the case law of the DC circuit. Ultimately, however, the Court found that it did not need to answer this question, as Mesa Power’s arguments would fail even under the more favourable standards of the DC Circuit.
