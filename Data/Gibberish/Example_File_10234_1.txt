Damages: in second case brought to ICSID by Tenaris and Talta, a discounted cashflow (DCF) valuation is embraced by arbitrators     (Editor’s Note: this article discusses the quantum findings in the December 2016 award rendered in ICSID case No. ARB/12/23; a first article, available here , discusses the award’s findings on jurisdiction and liability).   As we explained in a separate article ( here ), an ICSID arbitral tribunal has found in a December 2016 award that Venezuela breached treaties with Luxembourg an Portugal by expropriating the assets of the claimants, Tenaris and Talta, without compensation.  In the award, arbitrators Arbitrator 
   (presiding), Arbitrator 
   and Arbitrator 
   found Venezuela liable for the expropriation of the investors’ shares in Tavsa and Comsigua, following the state’s nationalisation of the entire iron and steel industry.  Notably, this is the second arbitration involving these claimants; in an earlier award, dated January 29, 2016 (ICSID Case No. ARB/11/26), a different tribunal awarded them $87.3 million, plus pre-award interest of $85.5 million on the basis of an interest rate of 9% for the expropriation of another investment in Venezuela. The reasoning of this first award as to damages is detailed here .  In these second, distinct proceedings, Tenaris and Talta were asking for more than $240 million in compensation and $471 million in pre-award interests in reparation for the expropriation. Below, we analyse the tribunal’s assessment of the investors’ loss, together with its decision on taxes and costs matters.
