No need to suspend arbitral proceedings pending EU investigation   Lastly, the tribunal rejected the Commission’s recommendation that the proceedings be suspended pending the review of the impugned Spanish measures under EU law. Spain had notified the Commission of the measures, in order for the latter to review whether they constituted illegal state aid. The Micula saga (for the latest episode, see here ) was cited as an example of what could happen were the EU authorities to conclude that the Spanish feed-in tariffs constituted illegal state aid.  Although this recommendation originated in the Commission’s amicus curiae as an alternative to a positive jurisdictional finding, the tribunal noted that Spain did not endorse it, while the claimant opposed it. The tribunal then concluded that the demand could not be entertained.
