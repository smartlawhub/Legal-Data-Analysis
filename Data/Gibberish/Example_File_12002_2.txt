ICSID tribunal had dismissed arbitration by majority in 2015   The decision of the tribunal, comprised of Arbitrator 
   (president) Arbitrator 
   (claimant’s appointee) and Arbitrator 
   (Equatorial Guinea’s appointee),* is notable in that it saw a majority of the tribunal decline jurisdiction after finding that the claimant made no investment in Equatorial Guinea had failed to enter a proper contract with the state; this despite having incurred substantial pre-contractual expenditures. This reasoning was strongly contested in the dissenting opinion of Mr Orrego Vicuña.  Both parties were represented by their own in-house teams, as well as Madrid-based José Merino Jiménez for the claimant, and lawyers from domestic law firm T&amp;E for Equatorial Guinea.**
