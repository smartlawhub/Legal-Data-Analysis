Promise of future returns is not an investment   While Isolux’s FET claim faltered, the claimant also claimed indirect expropriation.  The claimant argued, in particular, that its right to a future rate of return under the FiT system had been expropriated with the introduction of the new regime. Spain objected that this was not an “investment” capable of expropriation, as only “tangible” investments and acquired rights could so qualify.  The tribunal clarified the debate by holding that Isolux’s investment was its (indirect) participation in the Spanish plants, and that the ECT protected the claimant’s title to, as well as the value of, these shares. In this respect, decreasing returns could reduce the shares’ value and might constitute an indirect expropriation.
