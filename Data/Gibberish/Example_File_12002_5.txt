Tribunal adopts Salini test for investment   While the tribunal had no difficulty finding that GFHC was a national of Spain for the purposes of the BIT, its status as an “investor” depended on the existence of an investment in Equatorial Guinea. Likewise, the tribunal’s jurisdiction under ICSID’s Additional Facility Rules required that the dispute arose directly from an investment.  The arbitrators observed that investment case law progressively adopted the “interpretative framework” commonly described as the “Salini test,” which requires that an investment comprise a contribution, have a certain duration, and an element of risk. The tribunal also interpreted the BIT so that investments should be made in accordance with the laws of Equatorial Guinea.  The tribunal noted that the parties primarily debated the existence of a contribution arising under a contractual framework and in accordance with domestic law.  For a majority of the tribunal, its jurisdiction thus hinged on the existence of a valid contractual basis as an “essential prerequisite” to this jurisdiction. As we explain below, the majority found that none existed.  (The tribunal did not seem to have answered the claimant’s more minor contention that it also had intellectual property rights derived from its elaboration of the projects. A similar claim had been made – and also left unanswered – in Ickale v. Turkmenistan , leaving unclear the status of such “intellectual property rights” in relation to construction projects.)
