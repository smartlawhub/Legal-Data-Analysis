Subsequent loss of citizenship does not bar the tribunal’s jurisdiction   As a first objection to the tribunal’s jurisdiction, Uzbekistan contested the Kazakh citizenship of some of the claimants. Kazakh nationality is required under the BIT and the ICSID Convention to bring a claim, and the claimants all provided copies of their passports with their Request for Arbitration.  Uzbekistan argued however that under Kazakh law, which does not allow for dual nationality, individuals automatically lose their Kazakh citizenship in certain circumstances, such as when they acquire another nationality or work as officials for a foreign government.  Although the tribunal agreed that the applicable law was not clear, it ultimately disagreed with Uzbekistan’s analysis, finding that a positive act by Kazakh authorities was needed for an individual to be stripped of Kazakh nationality. This conclusion was “consistent with the presumption against statelessness that is a general principle of public international law.”  Citing the jurisdictional award in Micula v Sweden (see here ), the tribunal further held that passports are prima facie evidence that create a presumption of nationality – the onus is on the respondent to rebut that presumption. On the facts, the tribunal found that none of the respondent’s arguments succeeded in rebutting this presumption.  In particular, one of the claimants had seen his citizenship terminated by the Kazakh government. Yet, this was immaterial for the tribunal, because this occurred in 2014, and thus after the claim was registered with ICSID. In the tribunal’s view, it sufficed that this claimant was a Kazakh national from the date of the investment to the registration of the case for the tribunal to have jurisdiction rationae personae over this individual.
