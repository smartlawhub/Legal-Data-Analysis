Tribunal rejects parties’ attempts to fiddle with procedural calendar   Although the investor filed for arbitration with the SCC in October 2013, in January 2014 it sought to postpone the deadline for the filing of its first written submission, pending the enactment of a Spanish decree relevant to the claim. Spain, for its part, asked the tribunal to amend the procedural calendar and allow it to present a request for bifurcation at once.  The tribunal rejected both requests. In response to Isolux’s petition the tribunal found that “once a party takes the decision to initiate arbitral proceedings, it cannot condition its Memorial on possible future events […],” and that in any case the SCC’s arbitration rules provide for the amendment or modification of claims. As for Spain’s request, the tribunal would only allow the state to ask for bifurcation following Isolux’s first written submissions. This request was eventually made, and rejected by the tribunal in January 2015.  The record also reveals that Isolux filed a second arbitration with the SCC in June 2014, although the parties and the tribunal quickly agreed to consolidate the two sets of proceedings.
