Dissolved company is not an investment in compliance with domestic laws   Equatorial Guinea also claimed that the constitution of Nueva Edificación was invalid as per its laws, and notably because the claimant eventually withdrew the funds posted for Nueva Edificación’s social capital. As the latter fell below the mandatory minimum, this meant that Nueva Edificación was automatically in a state of dissolution.  The claimant argued that this was irrelevant for the jurisdiction of the tribunal, as Nueva Edificación had been validly constituted in the first place, even for a fleeting time. The raid on the funds, GFHC explained, was a precautionary measure pending an imminent expropriation.  The majority however accepted that under the applicable law (the OHADA Uniform Act relating to trading companies and economic interest groups), Nueva Edificación had indeed been dissolved in the absence of sufficient funds. “A company that finds itself in a state of latent dissolution can hardly be recognised as a company that fully exists […],” the majority noted, before observing that it saw no evidence of a risk of expropriation at the time.  As for INCOGESA, the state noted that its articles of association made no mention of the bank account where its capital was supposed to be posted by the shareholders (i.e., GFHC and the government), or indeed of the outlay of this capital from any of the parties. GFHC answered that INCOGESA was not governed by the Uniform Act, and no other legal provision predicated a joint company’s valid constitution on the contribution to its capital.  The majority disagreed, finding the Uniform Act applicable. As there was no indication whether or where INCOGESA’s capital had been posted by either party, its constitution was also invalid.
