The tribunal properly identified SAUR’s investment   Argentina’s first ground for annulment concerned the nature of SAUR’s investment, an issue particularly contentious in the underlying arbitration. In particular, Argentina built its challenges on a finding by the tribunal that SAUR was not a party to a water concession contract between OSM and the Argentine province of Mendoza.  In view of this clear holding, Argentina impugned the tribunal’s reasoning, claiming that it first based its jurisdiction over SAUR’s shares in OSM, and then decided the merits over the water concession contract. In finding that the state had expropriated this contract and should compensate SAUR for the loss, the tribunal allegedly dealt with two different investments/assets in different phases of the proceedings – and thus contradicted itself.  The committee refused to read any such contradiction in the tribunal’s reasoning. It underlined that the tribunal focused at every juncture on SAUR’s stake in OSM. While the tribunal mentioned that, under the bilateral investment treaty, the concession contract could be a protected investment, the discussion regarding its expropriation ultimately concerned its effect on SAUR’s share in OSM: as the concession contract was OSM’s sole asset, its termination necessarily affected the value of SAUR’s 32.08% stake. As such, when read in context, the tribunal’s reasoning suffered no contradiction.
