MFN clause applies only to substantive protections   In keeping with the typical tactic of claimants in disputes involving this kind of narrow jurisdictional clause (see Sanum v Laos , or Austrian Airlines v Slovakia ), BUCG also attempted to rely on the treaty’s MFN clause to widen the tribunal’s jurisdiction so that claims other than expropriation could also be arbitrated.  The tribunal alluded to the debate ( often chronicled in past reports ) regarding the scope of MFN clauses, and in particular whether such clauses can reach beyond the substantive treatment granted to investors to the procedural (e.g., dispute settlement) provisions found in investment agreements.  In the event, the tribunal held that it had no need to weigh in on this debate, as the China-Yemen BIT’s MFN clause applied to “treatment accorded to investors of the other Contracting party in its territory with respect to activities relating to their investments.” In the tribunal’s reading, the territorial scope of the “treatment” at stake unambiguously restricted the MFN clause to substantive treatment.
