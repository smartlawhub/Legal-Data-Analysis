 In newly-unearthed Energy Charter Treaty award (Isolux v. Spain), arbitrators grapple with denial of benefits, nationality planning, tax carve-out and EU law issues

</p>
<p>
 A copy of the long-confidential award in the case of Isolux Infrastructure Netherlands, BV v Spain has finally been obtained by
 <em>
  IAReporter
 </em>
 . (The award will be uploaded to our website in the coming days.)
</p>
<p>
 As we’ve

  previously reported
 </a>
 , the case is one of several dozen initiated against Spain under the Energy Charter Treaty in relation to changes to its solar energy sector.
</p>
<p>
 Of further note, the tribunal in this (SCC rules) arbitration had decided – by majority – in favour of Spain, marking the second of two positive results for Spain in such cases. (In the earlier Charanne award, discussed
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/articles/breaking-spain-prevails-on-merits-in-first-of-many-energy-charter-treaty-claims-in-the-solar-sector/">
  here
 </a>
 , Spain also prevailed.)
</p>
<p>
 As readers will recall, Spain sought to introduce a copy of the Isolux award into the record of a third arbitration with UK-based Eiser Infrastructure, Ltd, but these efforts were foiled by the Isolux claimant, who objected to the disclosure of the award, and by the tribunal, who refused to consider the then-unpublished award as an authority at a late stage of the proceedings.*
</p>
<p>
 Spain went on to lose the Eiser case, at least with respect to the fair and equitable treatment claim. Yet, as we discuss below, close scrutiny of the now-available Isolux award reveals that the Isolux case and the Eiser case pertained to the same Spanish measures.

  companion piece
 </a>
 , we turn to the tribunal’s reasoning on the merits as well as on the dissenting arbitrator’s opinion.
</p>
<p>
 Isolux was represented by Bird &amp; Bird, LLP in Spain and Latham &amp; Watkins, LLP’s Paris office. Spain relied on in-house counsel.

 <strong>
  Tribunal rejects parties’ attempts to fiddle with procedural calendar
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Although the investor filed for arbitration with the SCC in October 2013, in January 2014 it sought to postpone the deadline for the filing of its first written submission, pending the enactment of a Spanish decree relevant to the claim. Spain, for its part, asked the tribunal to amend the procedural calendar and allow it to present a request for bifurcation at once.
</p>
<p>
 The tribunal rejected both requests. In response to Isolux’s petition the tribunal found that “once a party takes the decision to initiate arbitral proceedings, it cannot condition its Memorial on possible future events […],” and that in any case the SCC’s arbitration rules provide for the amendment or modification of claims. As for Spain’s request, the tribunal would only allow the state to ask for bifurcation following Isolux’s first written submissions. This request was eventually made, and rejected by the tribunal in January 2015.
</p>
<p>
 The record also reveals that Isolux filed a second arbitration with the SCC in June 2014, although the parties and the tribunal quickly agreed to consolidate the two sets of proceedings.

 <strong>
  Familiar EU law controversies make appearance in dispute thanks to brief from the European Commission
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Spain’s first jurisdictional objection pertained to the relationship between the ECT and the legal order of the European Union. The state relied in particular on an
 <em>
  amicus curiae
 </em>
 submitted by the European Commission.
</p>
<p>
 The Commission reiterated before the tribunal the now familiar (see
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/articles/investigation-in-recent-briefs-european-commission-casts-doubt-on-application-of-energy-charter-treaty-to-any-intra-eu-dispute/">
  here
 </a>
 ) “implicit disconnection” argument: that the ECT does not allow for the arbitration of disputes concerning two EU member states.
</p>
<p>
 In addition, the investor-state dispute mechanism as provided in the ECT breaches the EU treaties, the Commission said, as the latter reserve disputes over EU law to the jurisdiction of European courts. Among other things, Spain cited in support of this thesis the Commission’s infringement proceedings against Member States over the termination of intra-EU BITs (see
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/articles/investigation-eu-member-states-table-differing-responses-in-face-of-commissions-infringement-proceedings/">
  here
 </a>
 ).
</p>
<p>
 While the tribunal considered these objections “of great importance,” and reviewed them with “the highest attention,” it was ultimately unmoved.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Tribunal reads no “implicit disconnection” clause into the ECT
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 As a first step, the tribunal concluded that the ECT’s article 26 allows for intra-EU disputes, as it founded the jurisdiction of the tribunal with respect to disputes “between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former.” The ECT elsewhere describes “Area” as the “territory” over which a Contracting Party has sovereignty, and held that it is uncontested that Spain has such a territory.
</p>
<p>
 For the tribunal, the investor, incorporated in a Contracting State with its own territory distinct from Spain’s, had brought its claim against Spain proper for an investment in Spanish territory, and not against the EU (whose territory is composed of all Member States’ territories). Therefore, the claim fell properly under article 26 and the tribunal had jurisdiction. (The same analysis, focused on the word “Area” in article 26, coloured the Charanne tribunal’s reasoning on this question.)

  As we reported
 </a>
 , the tribunal in Blusun v. Italy cited the outcome in the Isolux v. Spain case similar arguments by the European Commission and Italy. In the event, both tribunals reached the same conclusion, as had the

 tribunal before that in its decision on jurisdiction.)
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Tribunal
 </strong>
 <strong>
  sees no conflict between the ECT and the EU legal order
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 As a second step, the tribunal dismissed the argument that the ECT’s provisions, including its dispute-settlement mechanism, contravened the European legal order.
</p>
<p>
 Indeed, the tribunal noted that any incompatibility between the two legal orders would not pertain to its jurisdiction, but would need to be decided as a conflict-of-law question, which the tribunal would be competent to resolve.
</p>
<p>
 In addition (and “ex abundanti cautela”), the tribunal cited the findings of the Electrabel tribunal (see
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/articles/analysis-electrabel-ruling-examines-relations-between-eu-law-and-energy-charter-treaty-and-rejects-european-commissions-suggestion-that-case-should-not-be-arbitrated/">
  here
 </a>
 ) to the effect that the circumstances of the ECT’s conclusion generates a presumption that both legal regimes are compatible.
</p>
<p>
 The only potential remaining stumbling block to the tribunal’s jurisdiction was then the alleged monopoly of EU courts’ over the interpretation of EU law, under article 344 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
</p>
<p>
 However, the tribunal noted, article 344 concerns only the EU treaties – not the ECT. Besides, in practice, courts and tribunals daily interpret or even apply EU law, as directed by the EU courts themselves. As a result, the potential implications of this dispute over EU law did not bar the tribunal’s jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  No need to suspend arbitral proceedings pending EU investigation
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Lastly, the tribunal rejected the Commission’s recommendation that the proceedings be suspended pending the review of the impugned Spanish measures under EU law. Spain had notified the Commission of the measures, in order for the latter to review whether they constituted illegal state aid. The Micula saga (for the latest episode, see
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/articles/in-new-development-micula-claimants-fail-to-obtain-security-from-romania-as-this-would-contravene-eu-commissions-order-prohibiting-romania-to-comply-with-award/">
  here
 </a>
 ) was cited as an example of what could happen were the EU authorities to conclude that the Spanish feed-in tariffs constituted illegal state aid.
</p>
<p>
 Although this recommendation originated in the Commission’s
 <em>
  amicus curiae
 </em>
 as an alternative to a positive jurisdictional finding, the tribunal noted that Spain did not endorse it, while the claimant opposed it. The tribunal then concluded that the demand could not be entertained.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  No ground to pierce the corporate veil under the ECT
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Spain’s second objection focused on the ECT’s article 1(7), which defines an investor as “a company or other organization organized in accordance with the law applicable in that Contracting Party.” In Spain’s view, this required the existence in the Netherlands of material and human resources with business purposes, not the mere incorporation of an investment vehicle.
</p>
<p>
 Spain relied on the dissenting opinion of tribunal president Prosper Weil in Tokio Tokelés v Ukraine, and on the majority award in
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/articles/attempt-to-access-bit-through-portal-of-domestic-law-falls-short-tribunal-appears-to-split-over-propriety-of-locals-using-foreign-entities-to-sue-their-own-state/">
  Venoklim v Venezuela
 </a>
 (which arbitrator Derains also chaired), to support its request that the tribunal verify the ultimate owner of the investment – here, Spanish and Canadian investors, none of which should be protected under the ECT. In Spain’s view, the Dutch entity was but a “shell entity,” while all decisions were taken by the foreign investors.
</p>
<p>
 The arbitrators, however, disagreed with Spain’s interpretation of article 1(7) ECT, reading in it a mere formal test
 <em>
  ratione personae
 </em>
 : as long as Isolux was properly incorporated in the Netherlands, an uncontested fact, it should be considered as an investor for the purposes of the ECT.
</p>
<p>
 Nor were there grounds to pierce the corporate veil as Spain proposed here, at least in the absence of fraud. The tribunal noted that Mr. Weil’s opinion in Tokios Tokelés had been a minority one, while Venoklim revolved around a domestic Venezuelan investment statute that mandated lifting the corporate veil to certify that covered investments were genuinely foreign-owned.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Tribunal sees objective meaning of investment, but deems that acquired investments are protected under the ECT
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Spain further denied that Isolux had made an investment in Spain, given that it came into possession of its Spanish assets (a majority participation in the Spanish domestic firm T-solar, which itself owned several solar power plants) only as the result of a corporate restructuring that saw the Spanish conglomerate ISOLUX welcome the Canadian PSP as a co-investor. In the process, ISOLUX’s Spanish assets were transferred to the claimant, while PSP acquired some of its shares. For the respondent, this was not an investment under the ECT.
</p>
<p>
 Spain interpreted the term “investment” according to an objective meaning as developed by investment jurisprudence. The tribunal agreed with this position, in the event rejecting the investor’s contention that the ECT’s definition was “self-sufficient.” Indeed, the tribunal noted that most investment treaties, the ECT included, were relatively silent as to what an investment is, supporting the need for an objective definition. This meant the one progressively elaborated in past jurisprudence.
</p>
<p>
 On this point Spain’s arguments were unsuccessful, as the tribunal accepted that Isolux had an investment under the ECT. Spain did not contest that ISOLUX had had an investment in the Spanish power plants, but contested the transfer of assets to the claimant. Yet, as the tribunal noted, the ECT itself defines “make investments” so as to include “acquiring all or part of existing Investments.” This is exactly what Isolux BV did here, which meant that the tribunal had jurisdiction
 <em>
  ratione materiae
 </em>
 .
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  “Corporate planning” is not necessarily an abuse of process
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Spain had a further point to make regarding this restructuring: that it was constitutive of an abuse of process, an instance of “forum shopping” where the investor chose to allow a protected entity to litigate internationally an already-existing dispute. (Readers will recall that a similar objection succeeded in earlier cases, and most notably in
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/articles/philip-morris-v-australia-award-surfaces-tribunal-adopted-looser-test-of-abuse-than-seen-in-pac-rim-case-and-deemed-investors-corporate-restructuring-to-be-abusive/">
  Philip Morris v Australia
 </a>
 .)
</p>
<p>
 Spain stressed that, although the impugned measures – starting with a decree dated December 2012 – were enacted only after ISOLUX’s decision to relocate its assets with Isolux BV, the reform of the Spanish energy regulatory regime had been mooted long before.
</p>
<p>
 However, the tribunal turned this argument on its head, and noted that it would not be “strange” for PSP, in view of the prevailing regulatory uncertainty, to insist that its stake in the Spanish solar sector be invested through a Dutch entity that would be protected under the ECT. For the tribunal, “this would be no more than a case of ‘legitimate corporate planning’,” and it is doubtful that PSP would have been ready to invest absent such option.
</p>
<p>
 The tribunal noted that such corporate planning would amount to an abuse of process only with respect to pre-existing disputes. Given that the impugned measures were enacted only after the corporate changes, there was no abuse to be found.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Tribunal adopts narrow reading of denial of benefits clause
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Spain also sought to rely on the ECT’s denial of benefits clause contained in its article 17, which provides that a state can deny the ECT’s investment protections to a legal entity ultimately owned or controlled by a national of a third state.
</p>
<p>
 The tribunal first analysed this objection as one pertaining to the admissibility of the claims and not to its jurisdiction. Second, the arbitrators held that it was “obvious” that a state could not rely on this article retroactively. (The tribunal relied in particular on the narrow reading of this clause adopted by the majority in
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/articles/in-newly-obtained-energy-charter-treaty-award-ascom-and-stati-v-kazakhstan-arbitrators-offer-narrow-reading-of-denial-of-benefits-clause/">
  Stati v Kazakhstan
 </a>
 .) Since Spain had invoked article 17 only with its Counter-Memorial, the objection was without merits.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Tax carve-out deprives tribunal of jurisdiction over part of the dispute
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Alternatively, Spain challenged the tribunal’s jurisdiction over part of the claimant’s claim, related to a 2012 tax on electricity production aimed at reducing the tariff deficit. According to Spain, this measure fell within the ECT’s “carve-out” related to tax measures.
</p>
<p>
 The claimant accepted that the tax was a fiscal measure falling
 <em>
  prima facie
 </em>
 within the carve-out, but contended (
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/articles/in-depth-arbitrators-in-eiser-award-deem-ect-to-protect-against-total-and-unreasonable-regulatory-change-but-tax-measure-is-excluded-spain-fails-to-admit-favourable-scc-award-into-evidence/">
  like the Eiser claimant
 </a>
 had tried to, unsuccessfully) that it had been enacted in bad faith. The tribunal agreed that the good faith of the measure would be relevant for the applicability of the carve-out, lest states could easily flout investment protection by adopting expropriatory measures under fiscal guise (as a tribunal found happened in
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/articles/analysis-tribunal-confirms-russias-deliberate-destruction-of-spanish-investors-yukos-holdings-findings-distinguished-from-human-rights-court/">
  Renta4 v Russia
 </a>
 ).
</p>
<p>
 Yet, the tribunal also accepted the presumption that a state’s fiscal measures are taken in good faith, and that this presumption “is not easy to demolish.” And on the merits, the claimant’s argument – that the tax was discriminatory in that it did not target every electricity producer equally, and that it was not adapted to its official goal – were unable to overturn the presumption.
</p>
<p>
 (By contrast, the tribunal in RREEF v Spain chose to reserve the carve-out and bad faith question to the merits of the case, see
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/articles/an-update-on-solar-claims-against-spain-jurisdictional-ruling-comes-down-in-an-icsid-case-as-a-pair-of-awards-loom-and-two-more-ect-arbitrations-get-under-way/">
  here
 </a>
 .)
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Domestic referral procedure for tax is compulsory, and complied with, if only belatedly
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Notwithstanding the carve-out, the tribunal observed that the claimant had the possibility under article 21(5) ECT to debate the expropriatory effect of the carved-out taxation measures, provided the investor refers the question to the competent Spanish authorities first. As we
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/articles/in-depth-arbitrators-in-eiser-award-deem-ect-to-protect-against-total-and-unreasonable-regulatory-change-but-tax-measure-is-excluded-spain-fails-to-admit-favourable-scc-award-into-evidence/">
  reported
 </a>
 , the Eiser tribunal found that the claimant in that case had failed to comply with this requirement.
</p>
<p>
 In the present case, Isolux had maintained from the outset that this referral procedure was not compulsory, nor was there a mechanism in Spain to which to refer such question.
</p>
<p>
 However, the claimant eventually submitted the question to the Spanish authorities in 2016, and informed the tribunal that it had received an answer just as the tribunal closed the proceedings. This rendered the question moot.
</p>
<p>
 The tribunal nonetheless confirmed that the requirement was compulsory under the ECT (as indicated by the use of the future tense in article 21(5)), although a failure to comply would not automatically entail the inadmissibility of the claims.
</p>
<p>
 As we report in our
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/articles/in-now-public-isolux-v-spain-award-measures-that-later-breached-investor-protections-in-eiser-case-were-not-deemed-to-breach-isoluxs-legitimate-expectations/">
  companion article
 </a>
 , the claimant’s behaviour in relation to this question had an impact on the tribunal’s assessment on costs.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
 * By contrast, the procedural record of the Isolux arbitration reveals that the claimant itself – and not Spain – sent the tribunal a copy of the Charanne award, in a letter explaining that Spain had publicly disclosed the award despite its obligations of confidentiality. Although Spain disputed that it breached any obligation here, the tribunal took no decision and made no observation with respect to this award.
</p>
<p>
 The stakes here were probably lower than for the Eiser award, as two of the three arbitrators in the Charanne disputes (Guido Tawil and Claus von Wobeser) also sat on the Isolux tribunal and thus already knew of the Charanne award’s outcome and reasoning. In the event, the Isolux tribunal never referred to the Charanne award, although Mr Tawil’s dissenting opinion cited its earlier dissenting opinion in the Charanne dispute.
