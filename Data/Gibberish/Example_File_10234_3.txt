Claimants urge DCF methodology, while Venezuela favours comparable transactions approach   The claimants’ experts, Compass Lexecon, proposed that a DCF analysis was the most appropriate methodology. Regarding Tavsa, in which Tenaris acquired a 70% stake in 1999, the experts arrived at a value of $213.2 million. Furthermore, Compass Lexecon compared the DCF result to a “market multiple” valuation method, using comparable companies, which gave a similar result. Notably, this second method included a “control premium”, accounting for the added value that purportedly derived from the fact that Tenaris controlled Tavsa.  Compass Lexecon also advocated the DCF method with respect to Comsigua. They contended that their DCF valuation was borne out when checked against the aforementioned market multiples method, as well as when compared to similar transactions.  Venezuela’s expert (Credibility International) criticized the opposing expert’s methodology and findings both in relation to Tavsa and Comsigua. With respect to Tavsa, Venezuela’s experts focused in particular on Compass Lexecon’s optimistic assumptions in their DCF analysis, such as the beliefs that labour conflicts would disappear and that Tavsa’s level of production would increase. The market multiple method was also deemed inadequate, as it picked companies not truly comparable. Finally, Credibility International deemed the “control premium” to be unnecessary (and arrived at with no regard to Tavsa’s particular circumstances).  For both Tavsa and Comsigua, Venezuela’s experts advocated a methodology that would look at similar transactions. Although Venezuela also offered an appraisal of Tavsa via a corrected DCF analysis, this was nevertheless bolstered by pointing to two recent acquisitions by Tenaris in Mexico and Indonesia for prices which, adjusted for Tavsa’s circumstances, roughly comported with the DCF analysis’s result.
