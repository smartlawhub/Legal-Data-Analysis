Blue Bank, as a trustee, is not an investor under the BIT   After dealing with the consent issue, and as we previously reported, the tribunal then reviewed Venezuela’s argument that it lacked jurisdiction over the claimant, because the latter was merely the trustee of the Qatar Trust that in turn possessed the investment in this case. The respondent stressed that Blue Bank had never made any investment of its own in Venezuela. Moreover, the state contended that, in any case, Blue Bank does not control the trust: its powers as a trustee are fairly limited.  In the tribunal’s view, Blue Bank satisfied the BIT’s and the ICSID Convention’s nationality requirement, as it was a company of a contracting party. The question was then whether it had an investment in Venezuela.  Reviewing Barbados’ trust law, the tribunal found that trustees only manage assets for the sake of a beneficiary or for a specific purpose; they are paid a fee for managing the trust but have no claim to the performance of the trust’s assets.  The BIT however was clear that a company had to “invest” in order to qualify as an “investor.” Blue Bank had invested nothing on its own, had incurred no risk, was not even sharing in the eventual profit and losses, nor the owner of the Qatar Trust’s assets. There was thus no jurisdiction ratione personae in this case.
