A finding of denial of justice requires a “clearly improper and discreditable” judicial outcome   Pivoting to the merits of the case, the tribunal reasoned that it was only competent to judge if Mondev suffered a denial of justice from the American courts. It accepted that the criterion adopted by the International Court of Justice in ELSI in describing arbitrariness (“a wilful disregard of due process of law, … which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of judicial propriety”) was useful in finding a denial of justice.  On this basis, the tribunal found that the proper test was whether, “having regard to generally accepted standards of the administration of justice, a tribunal can conclude in the light of all the available facts that the impugned decision was clearly improper and discreditable […]”. (The “clearly improper and discreditable” standard of denial of justice was later cited by other tribunals as the correct standard to apply under international law (see, e.g., our coverage of GEA v. Ukraine ).)
