Partners in a joint-venture need not bring a claim collectively   Pakistan also contended that Impregilo was barred from bringing any BIT claim, even for its own loss. The state relied on the proposition that partners in a joint-venture cannot act in their individual capacity, but only jointly, in matters pertaining to the joint-venture. The state observed that in other respects, including related litigation in Pakistan, all partners acted together.  The tribunal was unpersuaded, noting that the joint-venture’s past behaviour was irrelevant to the formal requirements for jurisdiction under the BIT and the ICSID Convention. Even if the type of claims brought by an individual partner needed to be different from those pertaining to the whole partnership (a legal proposition from the jurisprudence of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal, but one which was doubtful in the tribunal’s eye), Impregilo’s claims for treaty breach would satisfy this requirement, as they are different from the joint-venture’s contract claims.
