High Court deliberately departs from foreign courts   Mr Justice Knowles acknowledged the decision of the US District Court for the District of Columbia (tasked with the claimants’ request for recognition of the award in the USA) to refuse to conduct a similar trial on the allegations of fraud. The District Court found that the tribunal had not relied on the fraudulent documents in its decision. Mr Justice Knowles interpreted the reasoning of the District Court narrowly, as referring only to the claimants’ assessment of costs with respect to the LPG project, and not to the indirect influence of these reported costs on Kazakhstan’s appraisal of the project. He also noted that a motion for reconsideration was ongoing in that jurisdiction.  Thornier was the case of the Swedish set aside proceedings, as the Svea Court of appeal had dealt with the state’s fraud allegations, but had found that the fraud would have had no direct, nor indirect impact on the award.  However, and “with respect,” the High Court found the Swedish Court’s treatment of the fraud’s indirect impact – through the importance granted to the state’s bid for the LPG plant – insufficient.** While the Svea Court of appeal had found that the bid’s valuation was itself not false evidence, the High Court saw issues in the claimants’ reliance on a valuation it knew (and concealed from the tribunal) to be the product of a fraud.  For this reason, the High Court held that there was no estoppel in this case, as the question of the fraud’s indirect impact on the award remained pending. In any case, these recognition and enforcement proceedings were concerned with the award’s compliance with English public policy – not Swedish public policy.
