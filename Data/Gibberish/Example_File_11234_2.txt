Tribunal looks at cumulative effect of measures in order to assess treaty breach   At the outset of its analysis, the tribunal rejected Ukraineâ€™s plea to analyse each element of the case in isolation, and instead favoured an overarching approach that would consider the cumulative effect of various events. (The same approach was embraced by the tribunal in Rompetrol v. Romania (where Mr. Lalonde served), which also concluded that some prosecutorial activity, taken as a whole, breached the fair and equitable treatment standard.)
