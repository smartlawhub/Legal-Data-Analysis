In second letter, tribunal interprets CAFTA’s transparency requirement   The second letter issued by the tribunal on April 17, 2017 ( click to download ) answers Costa Rica’s objection to the publication of nine communications between the parties and the tribunal (letters and emails), bearing on termination, costs, correction and suspension of the proceedings.  The tribunal cited CAFTA’s Article 10.21, which provides for the publication of, among others, all “pleadings, memorials and briefs submitted to the tribunal,” as well as all “decisions of the tribunal.”  Costa Rica contended that the letters and emails were “general correspondence”, and thus not contemplated under article 10.21. The tribunal disagreed, and provided for the publication of these documents on the ICSID website.  Although bearing solely on CAFTA Article 10.21, this interpretation has significant implications: many aspects of investment arbitrations are advanced through the exchange of letters – including, at times, arguments relating to arbitrator challenges, as we’ve recently chronicled – and such materials sometimes stay out of view of observers. The Berkowitz tribunal’s view, if embraced by other tribunals, could significantly broaden the impact of CAFTA’s transparency provisions.  The tribunal’s decision will also likely inform future discussions and litigation under other international legal instruments. The UNCITRAL Transparency Rules (which we reviewed here ), notably, also provide for publication of “any further written statements or written submissions by any disputing party” and “orders, decisions and awards of the arbitral tribunal.” CAFTA’s wording has also been copied by other treaties, including Article 9.24 of the Trans-Pacific Partnership .
