Competence-competence and separability to found the tribunal’s jurisdiction   Ghana’s main jurisdictional objection was that one question before the tribunal – the PPA’s validity – was non-arbitrable. Indeed, this question required an interpretation of article 181(5) of the Ghanaian Constitution, an interpretation reserved (at least as a matter of priority) to the Ghanaian courts and, as such, non-arbitrable.  This alleged non-arbitrability arguably affected both the PPA and the arbitration agreement contained therein – notwithstanding the clause’s separability – because the PPA was explicitly governed by Ghanaian law. Indeed, Ghana argued that the arbitration agreement in the contract was also subject to article 181(5), and thus itself invalid due to the lack of parliamentary approval.  At the outset, the tribunal noted that this case involved “[t]wo bedrock principles of international arbitration, namely, the principle of competence-competence, and the principle of separability of the arbitration clause from the contract of which it is part.”  These two principles, the tribunal found, were well-established and incontestable. But the tribunal found issues in Ghana’s interpretation and application of the separability principle: if, as Ghana argued, the same law applied to the PPA and the arbitration agreement, and application of that law led to the latter’s invalidity due to the invalidity of the broader contract, then the principle of separability was not properly respected.
