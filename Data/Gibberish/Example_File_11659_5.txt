Disregard of the law   Lastly, Venezuela reframed its above-noted allegations (i.e that the tribunal improperly upheld jurisdiction over contract claims and that it used defective valuation methods) under the frame of an alleged “manifest disregard of the law” by the tribunal. Under US law, a “manifest disregard of the law” occurs when the arbitrators are well aware of a legal principle clearly applicable to the case, but decide not to apply it anyway  There is some debate about whether such ground is available to set aside an award. But it was not necessary for the court to resolve this debate, as Venezuela’s claims were no more successful under this guise. The district court found that the tribunal engaged with the law and answered Venezuela’s legal objections. In “neither case did the Tribunal merely pay ‘lip service’ to the applicable law” – there was thus no “manifest disregard of the law”.  The award was therefore confirmed by the district court and Venezuela’s challenge dismissed. A request by Crystallex for Venezuela to post a pre-judgment bond was denied as moot.
