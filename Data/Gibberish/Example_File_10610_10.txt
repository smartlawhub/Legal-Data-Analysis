Tribunal adopts narrow reading of denial of benefits clause   Spain also sought to rely on the ECT’s denial of benefits clause contained in its article 17, which provides that a state can deny the ECT’s investment protections to a legal entity ultimately owned or controlled by a national of a third state.  The tribunal first analysed this objection as one pertaining to the admissibility of the claims and not to its jurisdiction. Second, the arbitrators held that it was “obvious” that a state could not rely on this article retroactively. (The tribunal relied in particular on the narrow reading of this clause adopted by the majority in Stati v Kazakhstan .) Since Spain had invoked article 17 only with its Counter-Memorial, the objection was without merits.
