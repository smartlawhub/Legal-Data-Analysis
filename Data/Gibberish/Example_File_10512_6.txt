Dutch law, not Ghanaian law, governs arbitration agreement   Rather, the tribunal ultimately found that the arbitration agreement (which had no choice-of-law provision) was governed by a different law than the PPA – Dutch law, the law of the seat. (The PPA provided for an arbitration in The Hague.)  Although this solution, the tribunal noted, is not universally adopted by tribunals and writers (some consider that arbitration agreements are governed by the same law as the main contract), the tribunal came to its view by virtue of the so-called “validation principle”: it is better to opt for a law that best guarantees the validity of the arbitration clause. The fact that the parties chose the Netherlands as the arbitration’s seat supported the tribunal’s view that they also intended to “detach the arbitration agreement from the domestic law or the courts of either Party.”
