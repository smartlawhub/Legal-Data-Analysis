Arbitrators express doubts about a right to security for costs, but bankrupt claimant’s “after-the-event” insurance policy obviates any need to rule definitively    Following Italy’s failed attempt at summarily dismissing the Eskosol case, a decision on provisional measures dated April 12, 2017 has recently been released by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes [ click to download ].   As we explain in our report on the summary dismissal proceedings, the case concerns investments in a solar power plant in Italy. Eskosol, a local Italian company who owns the plant, is under receivership and brought an ICSID claim under the Energy Charter Treaty, independently of a parallel claim initiated by Eskosol’s former majority shareholder, Blusun (for our recent review of the recently-published Blusun award, see here ).  The Eskosol procedural order reveals that Italy made a request for provisional measures of protection on January 18, 2017, seeking information about Eskosol’s funding arrangements, and Italy asked for security for costs.  As we discuss below, the tribunal of Arbitrator 
   (chair), Arbitrator 
   (claimant’s appointee) and Arbitrator 
   (Italy’s appointee) dismissed the request in its entirety.  Winston &amp; Strawn act for Eskosol in these proceedings, while Italy rely on in-house counsel.
