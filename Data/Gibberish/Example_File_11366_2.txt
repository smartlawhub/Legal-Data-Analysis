Tribunal pushes for the parties’ collaboration in answering first request for provisional measures   The claimants’ first request (dated June 16, 2016) concerned several hundreds of documents in possession of the Roşia Montană Gold Corporation SA (RMGC), the Romanian project company in which the claimants have an 80% stake (the remaining 20% is owned by Romanian state-owned entities).  The documents at issue in the request were covered by various confidentiality requirements under Romanian law which have hindered their use by Gabriel Resources in these proceedings. The claimants indicated that, one year after the registration of the request for arbitration, Romania’s inaction in relaxing the confidentiality obligations had compelled them to seek provisional measures from the tribunal.  This request appears to have spurred Romania to action, with the tribunal observing that, by the time of the hearing, the parties had collaborated such that only a few documents still needed release and declassification by the Romanian authorities.  The claimants’ full access to the declassified documents was however still hindered pending the signature of a confidentiality agreement and a custody agreement. In Procedural Order No. 2 [ click to download ], the tribunal thus ordered the parties to maintain their best efforts to complete the declassification process, and confirmed that Romania should have equal access to the declassified documents during the proceedings.
