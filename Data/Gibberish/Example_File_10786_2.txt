First proceedings before Cremades-chaired tribunal falter due to non-compliance with NAFTA Article 1121’s waiver requirement   The first tribunal was composed of Keith Highet (claimant’s appointee), Arbitrator 
   (respondent’s appointee), with Arbitrator 
   chairing.  Mexico raised a preliminary objection regarding Waste Management’s compliance with NAFTA’s article 1121, which requires claimants to waive their right to initiate or continue certain parallel proceedings with respect to the same measures at issue in the NAFTA arbitration.  Waste Management had sent a waiver to ICSID, but with a qualification: in its view, the waiver requirement was irrelevant for disputes that did not involve Mexico’s obligations under NAFTA.  Mexico contested this waiver’s validity, noting that Acaverde remained involved in administrative and arbitral proceedings with Acapulco and Banobras over the same measures at stake in the ICSID dispute.  In a decision dated June 2, 2000 [ click to download ], the tribunal first found that the waiver requirement was an essential part of the NAFTA parties’ consent to arbitration. Such waivers should be expressed in clear terms, and tribunals are entitled to assess the formal terms of such waivers, as well as the claimant’s material compliance (which should be judged at the time the waiver was submitted).
