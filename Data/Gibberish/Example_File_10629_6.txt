Tribunal is permitted to take Concession Agreement into account despite forum-selection clause   As we reported in our companion piece , the first Vivendi arbitration stumbled on clause 16.4 of the Concession Agreement that reserved the “interpretation and application” of the contract to the Tucumán administrative courts. The first tribunal considered that, as the case was inextricably linked to the Concession Agreement, it was unable to rule on the case before the Tucumán courts had the opportunity to rule on the dispute concerning the Concession Agreement.  The Vivendi II tribunal, however, found no difficulty in holding that it was allowed to take the contractual background into account in its review of whether Argentina was liable for a treaty breach – an inquiry, in any case, different from one looking for a contractual breach. A finding that the contract had been breached might simply be relevant for a finding of a treaty breach (although, in the event, the tribunal did not need to find a contractual breach to conclude that Argentina breached the Argentina-France BIT).
