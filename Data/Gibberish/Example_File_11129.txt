</p>
<p>
 A petition to enforce an investment arbitration award in U.S. Federal Court has brought to light a long-confidential ruling obtained against Ukraine under the Russia-Ukraine Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) by Russian investor Tatneft.
</p>
<p>
 Tatneft, one of the largest producers of crude oil in Russia, was awarded more than $112 million in damages from Ukraine following the loss of its 22.7% direct and indirect shareholding interest in Ukrtatnafta, a Ukrainian company owning an oil refinery in Kremenchuk.
</p>
<p>
 As we chronicle below, the case was unusual in that the claimant contended that Ukraine was liable for actions and omissions which ultimately led third-parties (Privat Group interests) – not the respondent itself – to gain control over Ukrtatnafta.
</p>
<p>
 We reported recently on this case when Ukraine failed to set aside the award before the Paris Court of appeal, in November 2016 (see our analysis
 <a href="http://www.iareporter.com/articles/paris-court-of-appeal-weighs-in-on-russia-ukraine-bit-awards/">

 ). Ukraine’s arguments in the Paris proceedings mostly concerned a September 28, 2010 decision on jurisdiction, which has still not been released. Below, and in our

</p>
<p>
 The claimant Tatneft is minority-owned by the Republic of Tatarstan, a sub-federal entity of the Russian Federation. (

  We recently reported

 on a second BIT arbitration against Ukraine, this time brought by the Republic of Tatarstan, arising out of its own additional direct shareholding interests in the same Ukrainian company Ukrtatnafta. A tribunal was

  recently finalized
 </a>
 in that new case.)
</p>
<p>
 The Tatneft arbitration was filed in 2008, and handled by a tribunal composed of
 <a href="http://www.iareporter.com/arbitrator/Brower">
  Charles N. Brower
 </a>
 (Tatneft’s appointee),
 <a href="http://www.iareporter.com/arbitrator/Lalonde">
  Marc Lalonde
 </a>
 (Ukraine’s appointee), and
 <a href="http://www.iareporter.com/arbitrator/Orrego-Vicuna">
  Francisco Orrego Vicuña
 </a>
 (chair by agreement of the co-arbitrators).
</p>
<p>
 (The award reveals that Tatneft had first appointed
 <a href="http://www.iareporter.com/arbitrator/Dolzer">
  Rudolf Dolzer
 </a>
 as arbitrator. Mr Dolzer’s appointment was successfully challenged by Ukraine before the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration. The reasons for this challenge have not been disclosed.)
</p>
<p>
 Cleary Gottlieb represented the claimant in the underlying arbitration (and now represents the Republic of Tatarstan in the new BIT claim). The law firm King &amp; Spalding represented Ukraine, along with Grischenko &amp; Partners as local counsel during the Tatneft arbitration, but has been replaced by Winston &amp; Strawn during the set aside proceedings.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Post-Soviet era, a joint-venture refinery investment is instituted via a Treaty between Tatarstan and Ukraine
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukrtatnafta was founded through a Treaty in 1995 as a joint-venture between Ukraine and the Republic of Tatarstan designed to refine Tatarstan-produced oil in a refinery located in Ukraine.
</p>
<p>
 Tatneft and the Republic of Tatarstan each held a tranche of shares in the joint-venture, with Ukraine’s stake ultimately held by state-owned Naftogaz. Although the Tatarstan side was supposed to contribute oil fields and extraction rights and activities to the joint-venture (as well as the supply of specific volumes of oil), its contribution changed following resolutions at general shareholders meetings in 1997 and 1998. Instead, the Tatarstan interests contributed only cash and shares in related companies.
</p>
<p>
 This agreement to let Tatarstan alter its contributions to the venture would prove crucial at a later date – when interests affiliated with Ukrainian oligarch Igor Kolomoisky sought to seize control of the venture, and persuaded Ukrainian courts to look dimly on the 1990s shareholder resolutions.
</p>
<p>
 In 2007, Ukrainian company Korsan acquired a 1% interest in Ukrtatnafta. Korsan is an affiliate of Privat Group, a conglomerate led by Mr Kolomoisky.* In the claimant’s narrative, Korsan acted as a stalking horse for Privat Group’s later “raid” on Ukrtatnafta.
</p>
<p>
 (Although Mr. Kolomoisky’s business empire was portrayed by the claimant as the victor in the struggle over Ukrtatnafta, neither party to the BIT arbitration had proposed him as a witness in the case. Thus, in an unusual procedural development in the lead-up to the March 2013 hearings, the tribunal expressed its own desire to hear from Mr Kolomoisky and thus asked the parties “to use their best efforts to secure the appearance and testimony” of Mr. Kolomoisky and another individual. Ultimately, Mr Kolomoisky appeared and gave testimony in the case.)
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Dismissal of board chairman precedes subsequent “raid” on Ukrtatnafta by Kolomoisky interests
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Frictions in Ukrtatnafta’s management first emerged in 2004 when Ukrtatnafta’s Supervisory Board dismissed the Chairman of the Management Board, Mr Ovcharenko. Although a Ukrainian court swiftly reinstated him, his reinstatement lasted only one day before Ukrtatnafta’s shareholders dismissed him again.
</p>
<p>
 Mr Ovcharenko would ride back into power in 2007 – and to the ultimate detriment of the Tatarstan/Tatneft faction.
</p>
<p>
 In 2007, Mr Ovcharenko reverted to the very same court that had earlier called for his reinstatement as board chairman. He sought a supplementary decision and interim measures (designed to facilitate enforcement). These were granted on an
 <em>
  ex parte
 </em>
 basis, on the reasoning that the earlier 2004 ruling on his reinstatement had not been implemented.
</p>
<p>
 In October 2007, armed with these favourable rulings, Mr Ovcharenko entered the Ukrtatnafta refinery premises with a state bailiff and a group of men, some apparently armed, and was reinstated as Chairman. Troops from the Ministry of the Interior were thereafter posted at the refinery.
</p>
<p>
 Mr Ovcharenko then proceeded to accumulate power and side-line the Tatarstan side of the management board, instead installing individuals affiliated to Privat Group on the board, with the minority of seats held by Ukraine’s Naftogaz. Meanwhile, as a result of court decisions discussed in more detail below, most shares were cumulatively gathered in the hands of Korsan and other entities close to Privat Group, while the Tatarstan side’s interests were progressively extinguished.
</p>
<p>
 An investigation into the October 2007 take-over at the refinery was opened by a local official of the Ministry of the Interior, but was quashed in May 2008 – on the motion, the claimant alleged, of high-ranking Ukrainian officials.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Suspect judicial actions buttress effort by Privat Group to seize control
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 On much of the above facts, the parties broadly agreed. The question before the tribunal was whether these events amounted to a “corporate raid” on their investment as argued by the claimant – and whether this raid had been (wrongfully) facilitated by Ukraine.
</p>
<p>
 On the subject of Mr Ovcharenko’s dismissal, the tribunal was untroubled by the 2004 events, given that the local court’s judgment to reinstate Mr Ovcharenko was formally complied with – if only for one day.
</p>
<p>
 More troubling in the view of the tribunal were the 2007
 <em>
  ex parte
 </em>
 decisions, which did not appear to be in compliance with Ukrainian procedural law. The fact that “the interim measures were issued thirty minutes earlier than the Supplementary Judgment they were supposed to enforce, d[id] not help to explain a logical legal sequence of these acts, which is normally the other way around.”
</p>
<p>
 Nor did the enforcement of the decisions properly obey the requirements of Ukrainian procedure. The evidence led the tribunal to find that the respondent’s narrative – of a peaceful, voluntary reinstatement of Mr Ovcharenko – was dubious.
</p>
<p>
 Similarly, the tribunal was unconvinced by Ukraine’s argument that Mr Ovcharenko’s subsequent decisions were solely managerial. Multiple decisions attested to Mr Ovcharenko’s effective take-over of the company and harm to the other shareholders’ rights, including banning the former Chairman, who remained a board member, from the refinery, or ceasing to send financial reports to the shareholders
</p>
<p>
 Lastly, the tribunal could not “fail to notice” that the criminal investigations into the take-over were discontinued in spite of sufficiently serious acts that warranted further inquiry.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Tribunal sees court judgments as annihilating Tatneft’s stake in Ukrtatnafta
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 This however was only one part of the “corporate struggle” designed to put control of Ukrtatnafta in other hands.
</p>
<p>
 Soon after Mr Ovcharenko’s reinstatement as Chairman, Tatneft and the other Tatarstan shareholders found themselves embroiled in legal disputes based on the alleged invalidity of their shareholding. These ultimately led to the loss of Tatneft shares in Ukrtatnafta.
</p>
<p>
 In a first step, a Ukrainian Prosecutor argued before the Kyiv Economic Court that the resolutions that had originally endorsed the Tatarstan side’s contribution to the joint-venture were invalid, because Tatarstan and Tatneft failed to contribute oil-related assets as originally contemplated under Ukrtatnafta’s founding treaty. Korsan (the supposed stalking-horse for the Privat Group) joined and supported the Prosecutor’s claim in that case. This legal manoeuver prevailed in the first instance proceedings.
</p>
<p>
 On this basis, and in a second step, Ukrtatnafta, now controlled by Mr Ovcharenko, initiated proceedings before the Economic Court of the Poltava Region seeking to invalidate Tatneft’s purchase of shares in Ukrtatnafta.**
</p>
<p>
 Although Tatneft’s purchase of shares as well as the aforementioned shareholders’ resolutions dated back a decade, apparently falling well outside a three-year domestic statute of limitations, both the Kyiv and Poltava courts decided to renew the limitation period in these two cases.
</p>
<p>
 The Kyiv court held that the three-year limitations period could be renewed because the Prosecutor had only been made aware of the Tatarstan side’s violations in 2007. Meanwhile, the Poltava court discarded the limitations period on the grounds that Ukrtatnafta could not have brought its claim until the Kyiv court had ruled on invalidating the original shareholders’ resolutions.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Sale of some shares to a pair of companies aligned with Tatarstan/Tatneft is very belatedly annulled by courts, under unusual circumstances
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 This was not the end of Tatneft’s problems: an earlier sale of stakes in Ukrtatnafta to a pair of other companies (Seagroup and AmRuz) that were ultimately allied with the Tatarstan/Tatneft interests came in for belated judicial scrutiny as well. In 2008, the Prosecutor, who had failed in 2002-2003 to invalidate Seagroup and AmRuz’s purchase of shares in Ukrtatnafta, applied to reopen those cases before the Supreme Court.
</p>
<p>
 Ukrainian law allows for such reopening, provided the courts have subsequently applied the same legal provision that was the basis of the earlier case in a different manner. Although such “reopening requests” should be made a maximum of one month following the subsequent case, the Prosecutor sought to rely on a two-years precedent – and Ukraine’s Supreme Court accepted that the Prosecutor had been unaware of this earlier precedent until he sought the reopening.
</p>
<p>
 The cases were then remitted to the lower courts for a ruling, and these courts annulled Seagroup and AmRuz’s share purchase agreement.
</p>
<p>
 These shares, now back in Ukrtatnafta’s hands, were then sold to Korsan (i.e., the company that the claimant alleged to be the stalking horse for the Privat Group raid).
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Arbitrators find fault with courts’ misapplication of statute of limitations rule
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 At the outset, the tribunal acknowledged that the contributions of the Tatarstan parties to the joint venture had shifted and that the justifications for this departure did not “appear to be quite convincing.” Nevertheless, the tribunal observed that this new approach had been unanimously endorsed by the shareholders at the time – among which sat many high-level Ukrainian officials.
</p>
<p>
 Thus, the tribunal was dubious about the decision, a decade later, to seek annulment of these shareholders resolutions before the Kyiv Economic Court. Rather, the tribunal was troubled by the “questionable” role of the Prosecutor following Korsan’s first investment in Ukrtatnafta.
</p>
<p>
 Indeed, as related below, the involvement of the Prosecutor appeared to be a common thread between all actions taken by Privat Group to take control of Ukrtatnafta. Without expressly characterizing this as a form of collusion or corruption, the tribunal took note of the numerous coincidences between Korsan’s increasing interest in Ukrtatnafta, and the proceedings initiated, reopened or litigated by the Prosecutor.
</p>
<p>
 The Prosecutor’s actions were facilitated by the Ukrainian court’s flexible application of the statute of limitations in the various cases related above. While professing that it “does not sit as a reviewer of the decisions of Ukrainian courts,” the tribunal however had doubts regarding this application.
</p>
<p>
 With respect to the proceedings before the Kyiv court, the tribunal held that the Prosecutor – whose “duty” was “to keep abreast of situations which have been the subject of an investigation” – knew or should have known by 2002-2003 of the Tatarstan side’s alleged violations of the joint-venture agreement through its modified contributions.
</p>
<p>
 Even less convincing was the Poltava court’s finding that Ukrtatnafta’s actions against Tatneft’s share purchase agreements were not time-barred. In the tribunal’s view, avenues existed for Ukrtatnafta to challenge these, years before the Kyiv court invalidated the shareholders’ resolutions.
</p>
<p>
 To be sure, Ukraine’s courts enjoyed a measure of discretion in applying a statute of limitations, but this discretion was limited, the tribunal said: “total discretion of the courts […] is incompatible with a legal standard.” And although, seen on its own, the interpretation of the court was “tenable”, the fact that it occurred within “a string of actions seeking the same corporate objective” (taking over Ukrtatnafta) had significance.
</p>
<p>
 Likewise, the reopening of the cases regarding Seagroup and AmRuz’s share purchases was questionable. First, the tribunal was not convinced that the precedent relied on by the Prosecutor was similar enough to these earlier cases to warrant reopening. Second, the Supreme Court’s decision (in a case where the defendants were probably not properly served) was unsubstantiated. That unsubstantiated decisions were a Supreme Court practice at the time was nevertheless “not likely to convince this Tribunal” that the decision was justified.
</p>
<p>
 (At first glance, the tribunal’s approach here seems to differ from that in the
 <a href="http://www.iareporter.com/articles/arbitrators-reject-greek-investors-claims-that-romanian-tax-enforcements-and-food-safety-inspections-breached-investment-treaty-romania-must-bear-4-million-of-its-legal-costs/">
  Spyridon v. Romania arbitration
 </a>
 , where the General Prosecutor had the power to ask the Romanian Supreme Court to remand an otherwise irrevocable judgment; when one such exercise of that prosecutorial discretion and the resulting decision of the Supreme Court were challenged by the investor in that case, the tribunal found no breach of the treaty because the Supreme Court’s decision had been “duly motivated.”)
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Tribunal sees consistently anti-Tatneft decisions as grounds for suspicion
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 The tribunal found additional faults with the findings of the Ukrainian courts.
</p>
<p>
 With respect to the legality of the resolutions that endorsed Tatarstan’s eventual contribution to the joint-venture, the courts had decided that these resolutions were invalid because contributions in kind, as contemplated under the 1995 Treaty and other related instruments, were essential to the joint-venture, and could not be waived simply by the shareholders without specific approval by Ukraine and the Republic of Tatarstan.
</p>
<p>
 With respect to Seagroup and AmRuz’s purchase of shares, the Ukrainian courts held that Ukrainian law did not allow these investors to pay for these shares, as they did, with promissory notes. Seagroup and AmRuz’s share purchase agreements were thus void for lack of payment.
</p>
<p>
 Although the courts’ decisions were generally “tenable” as a matter of law, their tendency to “systematically” side against Tatneft cast doubt on their propriety.*** All these adverse decisions were furthermore “linked by a common thread”: “the systematic role of the Prosecutor in the unfolding of this dispute.” Here as well, the tribunal stressed the entirety of the circumstances, and the fact that the Ukrainian judgments were steps in a general course of events that would lead to Tatneft’s eviction from Ukrtatnafta.
</p>
<p>
 Similarly, Ukraine sought to justify the cases that resulted in the annihilation of Seagroup and AmRuz’s shares by citing the “parity principle” under the Treaty, according to which the Tatarstan and Ukrainian sides of the joint-venture needed to be equal and did not allow for third-party investment in Ukrtatnafta. For the tribunal, this “principle” was not meant to be permanent and the composition of the shareholding was a matter of corporate governance in the hands of the shareholders; in any case, the tribunal stressed, all shares are now in the hand of the Ukrainian side.
</p>
<p>
 It is on this complex factual background that the tribunal reviewed Tatneft’s treaty claims, as reported in

 ).
</p>
<p>
 *** Paragraph 321 is worth quoting in full: “The Tribunal is mindful of the fact that on many occasions national courts tend to take a position on given points of fact and law that are the most favorable to the national interest involved in a dispute. To the extent that this approach can be justified in light of its compatibility with the ordinary meaning of governing provisions it might be considered tenable and cannot be a point of criticism. When this exercise, however, results in systematic decisions against the rights of the other party, and the latter’s arguments might be considered equally tenable, there is reason to believe that the process might have run astray of due process and the necessary impartiality in delivering justice.”
