Balance of prejudice to the parties in continuing the stay leads the committee’s reasoning   Both parties agreed that the committee should weigh (i) the risk that the respondent state does not honour the award; and (ii) the risk that the state, if successful in the annulment proceedings, cannot recover the awarded sums from the investor.  But the parties differed on the application of these tests to this case. Bolivia stressed its own prior compliance with awards, including in the Rurelec case (as we reported here ). The government also warned that there was no clear record of Quiborax’s own willingness and ability to honour its obligations, and that corporate entities can easily duck their responsibilities. While the claimants could be compensated for the stay in any case by the payment of post-award interest; the state risked losing its money forever if the stay were lifted, but the award later annulled.  The committee agreed that it should look at the possible prejudice that might befall each party. On the facts, the committee found that it was difficult to judge the likelihood of Bolivia recovering any sums that it might pay out in the short-term, due to a lack of financial information regarding Quiborax, and particularly NMM. Meanwhile, there was no basis to cast doubt over the state’s professed commitment to honour the award.  Since the prejudice to the investor in continuing the stay could be compensated by the post-award interests awarded by the tribunal, the tribunal ultimately opted in favour of continuing the stay.
