Contractual breaches by instrumentalities are not attributable to respondent states   According to Pakistan, the claimant was wrongfully seeking international resolution of what was at heart a contractual dispute. Impregilo countered that, although it was seeking relief regarding treaty claims (see below), the tribunal had jurisdiction over contract claims as well.  Whereas the Italy-Pakistan BIT did not include an umbrella clause, the claimant had two arguments for bringing contract claims within the ambit of the tribunal’s jurisdiction: (i) Pakistan’s consent to arbitration under the BIT is cast in broad terms, referring to “ any dispute”; and (ii) the BIT’s Most-Favoured-Nation clause would permit the claimant to import the umbrella clause found in Pakistan’s BIT with Switzerland.  In reviewing Impregilo’s first argument, the tribunal chose first to focus on whether jurisdiction could be extended over a contract to which Pakistan was not a party. On the claimant’s case, the conduct of WAPDA – the actual party to the contract – was attributable to Pakistan under international law; Pakistan denied this.  The tribunal accepted that the international law of attribution could extend a tribunal’s jurisdiction to cover acts of third parties. However, relying on the analysis of the (first) ad hoc committee in Vivendi v. Argentina, the tribunal found that this was true only for treaty breaches – not for contractual breaches, to which the rules of attribution do not apply.  Regardless of the interpretation of the terms “any dispute” in the BIT’s dispute settlement mechanism, Pakistan’s consent to jurisdiction in the BIT did not extend to related third parties such as WAPDA. As a result, the tribunal had no jurisdiction over the contractual claims (unless, it added, there were also at the same time treaty claims – see below).
