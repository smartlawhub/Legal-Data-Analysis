Tribunal pays lip-service to “deference” towards judiciary, but offers various reasons why it should be limited   Before switching to the assessment of Tatneft’s damages, the tribunal offered a few concluding words on the proper level of deference in applying the BIT’s protection to judicial decisions.  General “deference” was warranted when dealing with court decisions of a host state, but with requirements and limits. One requirement was that the respondent state’s courts be free of suspicions of corruption or incompetence. Moreover, for the tribunal, limits were found in egregiousness or “manifest injustice”, suggesting that decisions that are “tenable” (or “legitimately reached”, or “juridically possible”) should in general warrant deference.  In the present case, the tribunal however was “not at ease with an unrestricted application of the standard of deference.” Indeed, another limit of deference was the requirement to examine “the process as a whole,” and in “light of this broader perspective, deference cannot stand in the way of safeguarding treaty standards of protection.” Thus, “the fair and equitable treatment standard has been compromised by a number of court actions.”
