Tribunal distinguishes precedents based on Russian treaties   Readers may recall that the type of jurisdictional clause at play in this case is not only found in many of the BITs signed by the PRC, but also in investment treaties negotiated by Russia or its soviet predecessor. Both Yemen and the claimant also cited and debated precedents based on these cases, notably Berschader v Russia, RosInvest v Russia and Renta 4 v Russia .****  However, the tribunal deemed the Berschader and RosInvest precedents irrelevant, as the underlying treaties had no fork-in-the-road clause, “which is central to the present case.”  In Renta 4 v Russia, however, the tribunal had concluded that it had jurisdiction. While seeing differences with the present case, the BUCG tribunal ultimately concurred with the importance given by the Renta 4 tribunal’s to the treaty’s object and purpose.  The tribunal did not however discuss the findings of the Swedish Svea Court of Appeal that rejected the jurisdictional reasoning of the Renta 4 award. We reported on this “declaratory” decision by the Svea Court of Appeal here . We have since confirmed that the Swedish Supreme Court declined to hear a further appeal. As such, the Svea Court of Appeal’s “declaratory” judgment appears likely to lead, in due course, to formal set aside of the Renta 4 award.
