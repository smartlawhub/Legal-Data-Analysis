Full protection and security standard not to be confused with FET   While the claimant tried to prove a breach of the “full protection and security” standard resulting from the instability of the Spanish regulatory framework, the tribunal dismissed this interpretation of the standard. Here, the tribunal adopted the position spelled out most notably in Saluka v Czech Republic (see our looking back review here ), that the FPS standard primarily concerns physical protection against acts by third parties or state agents.  In any case, the tribunal quoted the claimant’s Spanish parent, who had long complained of the “lack of legal certainty” in Spain, including in arguments before the Spanish Supreme Court in 2012. “A party that decides to invest in a country that, according to this party, lacks legal certainty, cannot thereafter complain that this certainty was not ensured,” the tribunal held.
