Previously-unseen jurisdictional award waves away objections to Russian-owned investment claim in Tatneft v. Ukraine    We reported recently on the belatedly-released final award obtained by the Tatarstan-based investor Tatneft against the state of Ukraine (see here and here ).  While glimpses of a separate jurisdictional award had been visible thanks to a failed bid to set aside the awards , the full jurisdictional holdings have not been public until now.  However, Tatneft disclosed in recent days that it has initiated additional enforcement proceedings in London and in Russia. These proceedings have allowed IAReporter to obtain a copy of the September 28, 2010 partial award on jurisdiction, whose holdings are analysed below. (We will post the award itself on our site in the coming days).  In this partial award, a tribunal of Arbitrator 
   , Arbitrator 
   , and Arbitrator 
   (chair) resolved Ukraine’s jurisdictional and admissibility objections under the Russia-Ukraine BIT.  As readers may recall, Tatneft is one of the largest producers of crude oil in Russia, and had a 22.7% direct and indirect stake in Ukrtatnafta, a Ukrainian company owning an oil refinery in Kremenchug. Following the loss of these shares due to a “raid” by Ukrainian oligarch Igor Kolomoisky, Tatneft was later awarded more than $112 million in damages by the tribunal which found that Ukraine’s courts and prosecutors facilitated the raid. Readers can refer to our previous piece for the (complicated) factual background to the case.
