Both claimants’ and respondent’s conduct warrant some shifting of costs   While the tribunal reserved its main findings on costs to the merits phase of the arbitration, the conduct of both the claimants and the respondent elicited comments from the tribunal.  First, the tribunal decided to award the claimants’ costs with respect to the proceedings concerning the anonymous experts’ submissions. The tribunal recalled that the respondent’s counsels’ (inadvertent) disclosure of information derailed the whole process. In the tribunal’s words, “Respondent’s Counsel failed to adopt adequate procedures to ensure the integrity of the information entrusted to it. The Tribunal in this matter does not believe it is calling for a high bar of conduct. Rather, it observes a lack of serious engagement with the duties assumed under the Confidentiality Agreement.”  Second, the decision on jurisdiction records that the tribunal was “deeply troubled” by the conduct of Mr Kim during the proceedings. As the tribunal recounted it, “Mr. Kim surreptitiously took photographs during his witness testimony, later posting at least one of these photos on social media accompanied by offensive language and the statement ‘White &amp; Case must die’.”  Although Mr Kim subsequently apologised, the tribunal found this conduct “deeply offensive to Counsel for Respondent and to this Tribunal”, and the incident led the tribunal to discount substantially Mr Kim’s evidence in the proceedings. The tribunal also considered that this will factor in its ultimate decision on costs, at the issue of the merits phase.  Jones Day represented the claimants in this case; Mr Michael Swainston, QC, of Brick Court Chambers also appeared for the hearings. The Republic of Uzbekistan and its in-house counsels were represented by White &amp; Case LLP.  In a second article , we examine the tribunal’s holdings with respect to the legality of the investment and, in a third , about Uzbekistan’s bribery allegations.
