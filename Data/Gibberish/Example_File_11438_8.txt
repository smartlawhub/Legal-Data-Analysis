… but tribunal does not consider dispute as merely contractual   Finally, Yemen contended that the dispute was solely commercial and contractual in nature, and should be referred to the arbitral forum provided under the contract.  The tribunal swiftly dismissed this last objection, noting that the same set of facts can give rise to distinct treaty and contract claims (a common refrain in investment arbitration, as recently recalled in our article looking back on the Impregilo v Pakistan case). Besides, as BUCG’s claim cited the alleged intervention of Yemen’s military forces, it likely went beyond a mere contractual dispute.  The tribunal thus dismissed Yemen’s objections while refusing to extend its jurisdiction over non-expropriation claims as urged by the claimant; it reserved costs for the conclusion of the merits proceedings.
