Court of appeal judgment does not clarify the alternative ground for set-aside: alleged partiality of the tribunal for issues conflict   The Kyrgyz Republic sought to set aside the award on two grounds: wrongful constitution of the arbitral tribunal and breach of international public policy, but the Court of appeal only considered the latter ground. Since the Paris Court focused its attention on the separate public policy ground, the details of the former argument are not spelled out in the recent judgment. Possibly, it may have been linked to the two challenges brought unsuccessfully against Kaj Hober and Jan Paulsson in the weeks preceding the BIT arbitrationâ€™s hearings.  At that earlier juncture, Kyrgyzstan had raised several concerns about the arbitrators, including so-called issue conflicts arising from the allegedly pre-existing views of the two arbitrators in relation to the concept of denial of justice. (The Secretary General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, Hugo Siblesz had dismissed both such challenges .)
