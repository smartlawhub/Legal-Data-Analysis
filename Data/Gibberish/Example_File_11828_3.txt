Claimants seek remedy for breaches of discrimination, FET and indirect expropriation   In the claimants’ view, the Santiago court’s 2008 judgment therefore confirmed the existence of the claimants’ rights over the confiscated property. That they were nonetheless eventually denied a remedy constitutes a denial of justice and a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard. The lack of remedy, as well as Chile’s efforts to bar the claimants from obtaining such remedy, themselves amounted to an indirect expropriation of the claimants’ rights.  Without further elaboration, the claimants also cited articles 3 and 10(5) of the Spain-Chile BIT. The former provides for the prohibition of unjustified and discriminatory measures impairing the investment. The latter provides that arbitral awards obtained in investor-state proceedings should be “final and binding” for the parties.
