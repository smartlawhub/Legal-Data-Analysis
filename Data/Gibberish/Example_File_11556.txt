 CAFTA tribunal notifies parties of error in earlier jurisdictional award, as proceedings are slated to terminate; separate ruling on transparency is significant
</h1>
<p class="f-24">
</p>
<p>
 A tribunal hearing a claim by several US investors against the Republic of Costa Rica has issued two letters to the parties, notifying them of an error in an earlier jurisdictional award, and interpreting a transparency requirement in the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), the treaty underpinning the case.
</p>
<p>
 As we reported in October 2016 (
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/articles/cafta-time-bar-and-non-retroactivity-rules-largely-eliminate-claims-in-spence-v-costa-rica-but-tribunal-agrees-to-hear-complaints-of-arbitrary-judicial-conduct/">

 </a>
 ), the tribunal largely rejected jurisdiction over the nine investors’ claims of expropriation of beachfront property, leaving only certain narrow claims remaining in the case. Following the jurisdictional award, most of the claimants (the ‘Spence’ claimants) terminated their proceedings, while three claimants – Brett Berkowitz and his sons Aaron and Trevor – pursued their case. At the same time, the Berkowitz claimants filed to set aside the jurisdictional award before US courts (

 </a>
 ), and unsuccessfully petitioned the tribunal to stay its proceedings until the set-aside had been decided (

 </a>
 ).
</p>
<p>
 In a subsequent letter of March 20, 2017, the tribunal requested the parties to submit further information on the status of certain domestic proceedings regarding some of the land plots at stake in the arbitration. In separate communications shortly before and after this letter, however, both Costa Rica and the three remaining claimants requested the tribunal to terminate the proceedings. Apparently as a result of their view that the arbitration should be terminated, in a letter of April 3, the claimants declined to provide the information sought by the tribunal.
</p>
<p>
 As discussed further below, however, Costa Rica submitted the information requested, prompting the tribunal to issue a letter to the parties on April 17 indicating that its earlier jurisdictional award had contained a factual error regarding the domestic proceedings’ status.
</p>
<p>
 On the same date, the tribunal also issued a separate letter, responding to Costa Rica’s objection to the publication of certain communications between the parties and the tribunal. As we discuss below, this letter offers important clarifications on the duties of transparency in CAFTA and, potentially, equivalent duties in other international instruments.

 <strong>
  In first letter, tribunal seeks to terminate the proceedings in good order
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 The information submitted by Costa Rica in response to the tribunal’s request of March 20 clarified that certain domestic proceedings relating to the land plots had already concluded, contrary to the tribunal’s findings in its Interim Award on jurisdiction. (As we’ve

 </a>
 , the tribunal’s finding that these proceedings still remained incomplete underpins the claimants’ current efforts to set aside the award before the DC court.)
</p>
<p>
 Having reviewed this information, the tribunal’s letter to the parties of April 17, 2017 (
 <a href="https://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/italaw8743.pdf">

 </a>
 ) concluded that the Interim Award (which we’ve reviewed
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/articles/cafta-time-bar-and-non-retroactivity-rules-largely-eliminate-claims-in-spence-v-costa-rica-but-tribunal-agrees-to-hear-complaints-of-arbitrary-judicial-conduct/">
  here
 </a>
 ) thus contained “an error or omission of a factual nature” that needed to be corrected.
</p>
<p>
 In the tribunal’s view, such rectification was within its power even though the proceedings had been partly terminated, because it had earlier asked the parties to bring any such error to its attention.
</p>
<p>
 In light of both parties’ requests to terminate the arbitration, the tribunal then sought comments from the parties on how to properly do so while also taking note of the error – either by issuing a corrected interim award, or by a special mention in the eventual order terminating the proceedings.
</p>
<p>
 Despite the impending termination of the arbitral proceedings, the US set-aside proceedings seem to be still ongoing.

 <strong>
  In second letter, tribunal interprets CAFTA’s transparency requirement
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 The second letter issued by the tribunal on April 17, 2017 (
 <a href="https://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/italaw8744.pdf">
  click to download
 </a>
 ) answers Costa Rica’s objection to the publication of nine communications between the parties and the tribunal (letters and emails), bearing on termination, costs, correction and suspension of the proceedings.
</p>
<p>
 The tribunal cited CAFTA’s Article 10.21, which provides for the publication of, among others, all “pleadings, memorials and briefs submitted to the tribunal,” as well as all “decisions of the tribunal.”
</p>
<p>
 Costa Rica contended that the letters and emails were “general correspondence”, and thus not contemplated under article 10.21. The tribunal disagreed, and provided for the publication of these documents on the ICSID website.
</p>
<p>
 Although bearing solely on CAFTA Article 10.21, this interpretation has significant implications: many aspects of investment arbitrations are advanced through the exchange of letters – including, at times, arguments relating to arbitrator challenges, as we’ve

 </a>
 – and such materials sometimes stay out of view of observers. The Berkowitz tribunal’s view, if embraced by other tribunals, could significantly broaden the impact of CAFTA’s transparency provisions.
</p>
<p>
 The tribunal’s decision will also likely inform future discussions and litigation under other international legal instruments. The UNCITRAL Transparency Rules (which we reviewed

 </a>
 ), notably, also provide for publication of “any further written statements or written submissions by any disputing party” and “orders, decisions and awards of the arbitral tribunal.” CAFTA’s wording has also been copied by other treaties, including Article 9.24 of the
