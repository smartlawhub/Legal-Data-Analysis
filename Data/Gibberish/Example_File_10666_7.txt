Annulment committee examines its own powers   After rejecting the challenge, the annulment committee decided Vivendiâ€™s request for annulment in a July 3, 2002 decision (available here ). In this decision, the committee began its analysis by reflecting on its role and powers in such proceedings. The committee cited the MINE v. Guinea annulment committee for the proposition that it was not an appeal court, nor should it adopt a presumption in favour or against annulment. The committee also insisted on its relative discretion in deciding on annulment, including on the fact that it is not bound by the requests of the parties in deciding on a partial or complete annulment of the award.
