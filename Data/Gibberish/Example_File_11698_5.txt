Proportionality test introduced via human rights case-law; Mexico fails the test   For the Tecmed tribunal, two relevant “characteristics” of the state’s measure were its proportionality and reasonableness. Explicitly influenced by the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights – but without explaining why this case-law was relevant under the applicable law** – the tribunal sought to “assess whether the Resolution [wa]s proportional to [the] circumstances, and to the neutralization of the economic and commercial value of the Claimant’s investment.”  While states were owed “due deference” in choosing policy priorities, the tribunal said, this deference did not prevent it from assessing the reasonableness of measures adopted to pursue these priorities.  On the facts, the tribunal found that the Resolution, despite citing minor breaches of the permit by the investor, was mostly based on “socio-political factors” – i.e., opposition to the landfill from local citizens and authorities, and efforts to relocate it farther from Hermosillo. In the tribunal’s assessment, INE’s refusal to renew the permit was primarily a “strategy to put pressure on [the investor] to relocate”, and was not based on public health or environmental concerns.  The tribunal then weighed this “community pressure” against the interference with the investment. It concluded that, since such pressure did not amount to “a serious urgent situation, crisis, need or social emergency”, INE’s decision was not proportional. In its assessment, the tribunal also emphasized the investor’s continually lawful operation of the landfill – particularly regarding its obligations on ecological balance and public health – and that the strength of the alleged “community pressure” was doubtful.
