Claimant files for arbitration while Ghana seeks to stop the arbitration in domestic courts   Ghana and Balkan Energy entered into the Power Purchase Agreement in 2007. The PPA provided for the refurbishment, commissioning and operating of a power barge (a ship containing a generator that produces electricity), to alleviate a grave energy shortage at the time. Under the PPA, Ghana had to connect the barge to its electricity grid, and take and pay for the generated electricity.  Importantly, article 181(5) of the Ghanaian Constitution requires parliamentary approval for any “international business or economic transaction to which the Government is a party.” However, the PPA recorded Ghana’s assurances that it had full power and authorization to enter the Agreement. As a condition precedent, the PPA also needed a letter from Ghana’s Attorney General confirming that all authorizations have been obtained. This letter was provided; it held that article 181(5) was inapplicable to the PPA, as it was signed with a local company: Balkan Energy’s Ghanaian subsidiary.
