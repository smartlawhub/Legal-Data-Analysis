FET standard imported via MFN   The Russia-Ukraine BIT at the basis of Tatneft’s claim had no FET clause, but the parties agreed that the BIT’s most-favoured nation clause allowed FET to be imported from the UK-Ukraine BIT.  The parties however discussed the FET standard’s interpretation, and its application to judicial conduct. In the investor’s view, the FET standard went beyond customary international law and the associated standard of denial of justice, while Ukraine opined that FET did no more than encompass this customary international law standard.  The tribunal seemed to take the claimant’s side on this point. For the purpose of its review, however, the tribunal was satisfied that it was “not difficult to ascertain that [FET] encompasses today at least: (a) protection against arbitrary and unreasonable measures, discrimination, and denial of justice, (b) the right to procedural propriety and due process, and (c) the assurance of a predictable, consistent and stable legal framework.”
