Looking Back: In Impregilo v Pakistan case, arbitrators needed to grapple with distinction between treaty/contract claims and scope of umbrella clause     (Editor’s Note: This is a report in our new series examining investment treaty awards that were rendered prior to the launch of IAReporter in 2008. Other articles in this series can be found here .)   Rendered in 2005, the jurisdictional decision in Impregilo SpA v. Pakistan grappled with several issues that remain perennial subjects of debate in investment arbitration, including the question of the distinction between contract and treaty claims and the scope of umbrella clauses.  Italian investor Impregilo S.p.A was the leader of a joint venture, GBC, set up to develop a hydropower project in Pakistan. In 1995, GBC contracted with Pakistan’s Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) for the construction of the dam and related works, with a value of approximately $500 million.  As is usual in this type of projects an engineer served as an agent for Pakistan, and a Dispute Resolution Board (DRB) was created to handle disputes prior to any litigation.  Although the expected completion date was originally in 2000, the works suffered numerous delays. Impregilo attributed these to alleged contractual failures of WAPDA and the engineer. Moreover, the investor complained that the respondent had frustrated the contractual dispute resolution mechanism by failing to appoint a chairman to the DRB for more than two years.  In 2003, Impregilo filed a claim with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), under the 1997 Italy-Pakistan BIT.* The proceedings culminated in an April 22, 2005 decision on jurisdiction [ click to download ].  As explained below, Pakistan raised several jurisdictional objections that were partly successful. Following the jurisdictional ruling, the parties settled the case, leaving the merits undecided. As part of the settlement, GBC was awarded $98 million by Pakistan (the September 25, 2005 Order of Discontinuance of Proceedings can be downloaded here ).  Arbitrators in this case were Arbitrator 
   (presiding), Arbitrator 
   (claimant’s appointee) and Arbitrator 
   (respondent’s appointee).  The proceedings saw an unusual number of lawyers who would later specialize in investment arbitration. Counsel for the claimant were Arbitrator
