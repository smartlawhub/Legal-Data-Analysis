Ukrtatnafta Treaty does not bar BIT arbitration   As we explained in our prior reporting on the dispute’s factual background, Ukrtatnafta was founded by a 1995 Treaty between Ukraine and Tatarstan. The Treaty contemplated the initial “parity” of the parties with respect to the joint-venture, with 50% of the shares reserved to the Tatarstan side and the Ukrainian side.  The Treaty also included its own dispute-settlement mechanisms, including for disputes between the states’ business entities, which should be heard by the relevant local courts. When Tatneft later sued under the BIT, Ukraine argued that the Ukrtatnafta Treaty was lex specialis between the parties, thus superseding the BIT.  In reply, the tribunal stressed that there was some difficulty in deciding which treaty was lex specialis in this case. The relevant criteria, in the tribunal’s analysis, was the nature of the dispute: since it concerned business and investment activities and opposed an investor to the state, it fell more naturally under the ambit of the BIT. Besides, as the dispute involved more parties than Ukraine and Tatarstan, it went beyond the framework of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty and the “diplomatic” disputes contemplated thereunder.
