“Manifest disregard of the law” a valid ground for set aside   This choice-of-law question was aimed in particular at Mesa Power’s effort to claim that the tribunal committed a “manifest disregard of the law” in deciding the claims.  The existence of “manifest disregard of the law” as an independent ground for setting aside an award has stirred controversy in the US for decades.  Acknowledging the controversy, the Court nonetheless pursued its earlier policy of assuming, without deciding, that Mesa Power could validly present a claim for manifest disregard of the law. The DC Court, however, stressed that its scope of review under this and the other grounds invoked by the claimant – i.e. the tribunal’s alleged misbehaviour and alleged excess of powers – remained narrow, and required more than a disagreement with the tribunal’s interpretation of the law being applied.
