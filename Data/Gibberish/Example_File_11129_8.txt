Tribunal sees consistently anti-Tatneft decisions as grounds for suspicion   The tribunal found additional faults with the findings of the Ukrainian courts.  With respect to the legality of the resolutions that endorsed Tatarstan’s eventual contribution to the joint-venture, the courts had decided that these resolutions were invalid because contributions in kind, as contemplated under the 1995 Treaty and other related instruments, were essential to the joint-venture, and could not be waived simply by the shareholders without specific approval by Ukraine and the Republic of Tatarstan.  With respect to Seagroup and AmRuz’s purchase of shares, the Ukrainian courts held that Ukrainian law did not allow these investors to pay for these shares, as they did, with promissory notes. Seagroup and AmRuz’s share purchase agreements were thus void for lack of payment.  Although the courts’ decisions were generally “tenable” as a matter of law, their tendency to “systematically” side against Tatneft cast doubt on their propriety.*** All these adverse decisions were furthermore “linked by a common thread”: “the systematic role of the Prosecutor in the unfolding of this dispute.” Here as well, the tribunal stressed the entirety of the circumstances, and the fact that the Ukrainian judgments were steps in a general course of events that would lead to Tatneft’s eviction from Ukrtatnafta.  Similarly, Ukraine sought to justify the cases that resulted in the annihilation of Seagroup and AmRuz’s shares by citing the “parity principle” under the Treaty, according to which the Tatarstan and Ukrainian sides of the joint-venture needed to be equal and did not allow for third-party investment in Ukrtatnafta. For the tribunal, this “principle” was not meant to be permanent and the composition of the shareholding was a matter of corporate governance in the hands of the shareholders; in any case, the tribunal stressed, all shares are now in the hand of the Ukrainian side.  It is on this complex factual background that the tribunal reviewed Tatneft’s treaty claims, as reported in our second article on the subject.
