In a jurisprudential departure, Shin-Fortier-Douglas decline jurisdiction and reject theory that investor could accept BIT consent to arbitration after Venezuela notified its denunciation of ICSID Convention    In an apparent first, Venezuela has defeated on jurisdictional grounds an arbitration filed after the country had notified ICSID in January of 2012 of its denunciation of the ICSID Convention, but mere days before that denunciation took full effect.  The development comes in the case of Fábrica de Vidrios Los Andes, C.A. and Owens-Illinois de Venezuela vs. Venezuela*  In an award dated November 13, 2017, the unanimous tribunal of Arbitrator 
   (Chair), Arbitrator 
   (claimants’ appointee) and Arbitrator 
   (Venezuela’s appointee) dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention.  Volterra Fietta in London and Escritorio Muci-Abraham &amp; Asociados in Caracas represented the claimants in this case; Venezuela relied on its in-house counsel assisted by Guglielmino &amp; Asociados from Buenos Aires and Diego Brian Gosis in Florida.  The tribunal’s reasoning is notable in that it breaks with other recent cases that had to deal with Venezuela’s denunciation of the ICSID Convention.
