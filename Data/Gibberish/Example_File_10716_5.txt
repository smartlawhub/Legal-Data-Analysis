Claims ceased to exist following settlement agreement between OTH and Algeria   The settlement agreement between OTH and Algeria’s investment fund “confirm[ed] and reinforce[ed]” the tribunal’s conclusion. For the tribunal, “the Claimant cannot bring claims in this arbitration that OTH decided to settle, as the settlement clearly resolved the dispute that the Claimant has brought before this Tribunal as is shown by the comparison of the notices of disputes above.” The dispute had ceased to exist in the same way that it would have had the OTH arbitration proceeded to an award on the merits, the tribunal held.  In the tribunal’s view, this conclusion was supported in view of the counterfactual: if settlements between a direct shareholder and a state could be disregarded by an indirect shareholder, states would have no incentive to settle – resolve disputes amicably, in the language of many BITs – in the first place.  It was also reinforced by the fact that OTMTI had sold its investment to VimpelCom. The tribunal could not find any indication that the claimant had reserved for its benefit the investment claims against Algeria. Besides, Mr Sawiris, an experienced businessman, confirmed under examination that the selling price in such circumstances should have reflected the existence of the pending claims.
