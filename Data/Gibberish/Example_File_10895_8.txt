Other alleged breaches with respect to the SPAs dismissed along the same lines   Several other alleged breaches of laws and regulations raised by Uzbekistan (such as that the registered SPAs were a sham or a fictitious transaction, or that the transaction ran athwart Uzbek’s foundations of the legal order or morality) were dismissed by the majority along the same lines, for either lacking in intent or not being serious enough. (The anonymous dissenter either found that the claimants’ conduct was intentional, or that the breaches were serious enough to fall under the legality requirement.) A few laws and regulations were also found not to apply to the claimants or their conduct.  Uzbekistan also put forward the theory that the claimants’ conduct caused harm to the state, “the BC and KC minority shareholders, the TSE and the brokers, resulting in illicit benefits to Claimants”, in violation of both the Uzbek Civil and Criminal code.  The tribunal accepted that a criminal offence would reach the threshold of the BIT’s legality requirement, and that arbitrators had the power to determine the reality of such offence. However, the tribunal ultimately found that the respondent failed to prove the alleged crimes.
