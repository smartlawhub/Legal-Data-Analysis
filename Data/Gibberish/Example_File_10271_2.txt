Disputed factual background   In 2005, the claimants sought to acquire majority stakes in two cement plants (BC and KC) in Uzbekistan. The decision tersely suggests that the claimants’ “perceived limitation” of the Tashkent Stock Exchange “relating to spread limits and investment protection” led them to take extra steps to ensure that the transaction was fair, as they entered a complex share purchase agreement contractual framework (indeed, the legality of this framework is the main subject of the third jurisdictional objection, discussed here ). Over the next years, the claimants acquired additional minority shareholdings to fortify their stakes in BC and KC. They eventually held a 83% stake in BC and a 89% stake in KC.  The parties’ narratives surrounding the ensuing lifespan of the investment diverge considerably.  In the claimants’ account, beginning in 2010, the cement plants were subjected to “a campaign of harassment by Respondent”, which took the shape of criminal and regulatory investigations. This culminated in a criminal verdict entered against BC and four of its managers. The judgment further ordered the transfer of a 51% ownership stake in BC to the Uzbek government.  Meanwhile, former minority shareholders represented by the Uzbek government succeeded in a domestic legal case to recover their shares, under the theory that they had been coerced earlier into selling these shares (comprising some 12% of KC) to the claimants.  Contrary to this narrative, the respondent offered a story of shoddy deals, corrupt payments, tax evasion, and coercion. In the respondent’s eyes, it was the allegedly criminal activities swirling around BC and KC that gave rise to the domestic criminal proceedings.  The tribunal only resolved this discrepancy as far as needed to deal with the preliminary objections. We study the tribunal’s treatment of (some of) the corruption allegations in a companion article .
