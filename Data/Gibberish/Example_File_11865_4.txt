Tribunal casts doubt over “right” to collect costs award, and denies Italy’s request   In its recent order, the tribunal questioned the analysis of the earlier RSM v Saint Lucia tribunal, pointing out that the state’s putative right at the basis of such a security-for-costs request is not a right to claim reimbursement for such costs (as this right would be unaffected by the presence or absence of assets) – but rather a right to effective relief in case costs are awarded to a party at the conclusion of the arbitration.  The tribunal acknowledged that states might well be concerned about the enforcement of costs awards in their favour, but would (presumably) “be unhappy to see a similar argument about a right to effective relief used against them.”  The tribunal deemed the issue here to be related to collection of any compensation granted in an award, and on this question the ICSID Convention reserves the “execution of the award” to national laws. For the tribunal, “there is something analytically curious about the notion that an ICSID tribunal, while not empowered to protect a claimant’s ability to collect on a possible merits award, nonetheless should intervene to protect a State’s asserted “right” to collect on a possible costs award.”  Without taking a final position in this debate, the tribunal cited  IAReporter’s report of the (still unpublished) decision in Valle Verde v Venezuela for the conclusion that the right claimed by Italy does not exist, while noting at the same time that other tribunals (such as EuroGas v Slovakia, see here ) have found the opposite.  In any event, these tribunals also held that security for costs should only be granted in exceptional circumstances. On the facts in this case, the Eskosol tribunal was not convinced that the case’s circumstances warranted the measures sought by Italy, particularly given that Eskosol ATE’s insurance policy was there to assuage Italy’s concerns.  Moreover, the tribunal doubted that Italy’s request would be proportional given Eskosol’s likely difficulties in collecting the funds. “A tribunal should not lightly recommend a provisional measure that could impede access to justice,” the award reads.
