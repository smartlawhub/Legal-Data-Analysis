Alleged state facilitation of losses related to unpaid oil delivery   A discrete part of Tatneft’s claim concerned oil deliveries it made to Ukrtatnafta, whose payment had allegedly been frustrated by the activities of Privat Group. In the claimant’s narrative, multiple intermediaries in these deliveries allowed Privat Group to siphon away Ukrtatnafta’s payment, in a scheme used by “private raiders” in Ukraine. According to the claimant, Ukrainian courts were allegedly complicit, and Ukraine therefore liable, in permitting the corporate manipulations at the root of the claimant’s frustrated payments.  Without really opining on the possibility to find a state liable under this theory, the tribunal rejected Tatneft’s argument on the basis of a lack of evidence regarding the causal link between Ukraine’s conduct and the claimant’s harm (although “elements of State participation in facilitating [the alleged] schemes [we]re present in the evidentiary record”). Ukraine’s role in all this was, if anything, too remote to ground liability.
