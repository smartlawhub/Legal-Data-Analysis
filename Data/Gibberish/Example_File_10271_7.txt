Investor need not be “active” to be protected by the BIT   A further facet of Uzbekistan’s jurisdictional objection regarding the claimants’ status as investors relied on their alleged “passivity”. In the respondent’s view, the terms of the BIT (such as the requirement that the investment be “made”) required investors to take “active” step in investing. Uzbekistan pointed to the lack of evidence that claimants engaged in the management of BC and KC.  Readers will recall that a tribunal in one of Standard Chartered Bank’s disputes over a Tanzanian power plant project adopted such an interpretation (see here ).  However, the tribunal, in not altogether clear language,*** differed, and found that the BIT did not include such a requirement. The decision on jurisdiction explicitly distinguishes the precedent in Standard Chartered Bank, stressing that the tribunal in that case made a distinction between investments ‘of’ the claimant and ‘by’ the claimant.**** As the Kazakh claimants were not looking to merely hold a financial interest but also to manage and develop the cement plants, the tribunal was satisfied that it was distinguishable from this precedent.  In any case, the tribunal also found that the claimants proved that they were active investors with respect to the investment.
