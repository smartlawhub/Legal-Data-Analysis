In newly-unearthed Energy Charter Treaty award (Isolux v. Spain), arbitrators grapple with denial of benefits, nationality planning, tax carve-out and EU law issues    A copy of the long-confidential award in the case of Isolux Infrastructure Netherlands, BV v Spain has finally been obtained by IAReporter . (The award will be uploaded to our website in the coming days.)  As we’ve previously reported , the case is one of several dozen initiated against Spain under the Energy Charter Treaty in relation to changes to its solar energy sector.  Of further note, the tribunal in this (SCC rules) arbitration had decided – by majority – in favour of Spain, marking the second of two positive results for Spain in such cases. (In the earlier Charanne award, discussed here , Spain also prevailed.)  As readers will recall, Spain sought to introduce a copy of the Isolux award into the record of a third arbitration with UK-based Eiser Infrastructure, Ltd, but these efforts were foiled by the Isolux claimant, who objected to the disclosure of the award, and by the tribunal, who refused to consider the then-unpublished award as an authority at a late stage of the proceedings.*  Spain went on to lose the Eiser case, at least with respect to the fair and equitable treatment claim. Yet, as we discuss below, close scrutiny of the now-available Isolux award reveals that the Isolux case and the Eiser case pertained to the same Spanish measures.  Arbitrators in the Isolux case were Arbitrator 
   (chair), Arbitrator 
   (investor’s appointee) and Arbitrator 
   (Spain’s appointee).  Below, we review the tribunal’s findings with respect to Spain’s jurisdictional and admissibility objections. In a companion piece , we turn to the tribunal’s reasoning on the merits as well as on the dissenting arbitrator’s opinion.  Isolux was represented by Bird &amp; Bird, LLP in Spain and Latham &amp; Watkins, LLP’s Paris office. Spain relied on in-house counsel.
