Post-Soviet era, a joint-venture refinery investment is instituted via a Treaty between Tatarstan and Ukraine   Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukrtatnafta was founded through a Treaty in 1995 as a joint-venture between Ukraine and the Republic of Tatarstan designed to refine Tatarstan-produced oil in a refinery located in Ukraine.  Tatneft and the Republic of Tatarstan each held a tranche of shares in the joint-venture, with Ukraine’s stake ultimately held by state-owned Naftogaz. Although the Tatarstan side was supposed to contribute oil fields and extraction rights and activities to the joint-venture (as well as the supply of specific volumes of oil), its contribution changed following resolutions at general shareholders meetings in 1997 and 1998. Instead, the Tatarstan interests contributed only cash and shares in related companies.  This agreement to let Tatarstan alter its contributions to the venture would prove crucial at a later date – when interests affiliated with Ukrainian oligarch Igor Kolomoisky sought to seize control of the venture, and persuaded Ukrainian courts to look dimly on the 1990s shareholder resolutions.  In 2007, Ukrainian company Korsan acquired a 1% interest in Ukrtatnafta. Korsan is an affiliate of Privat Group, a conglomerate led by Mr Kolomoisky.* In the claimant’s narrative, Korsan acted as a stalking horse for Privat Group’s later “raid” on Ukrtatnafta.  (Although Mr. Kolomoisky’s business empire was portrayed by the claimant as the victor in the struggle over Ukrtatnafta, neither party to the BIT arbitration had proposed him as a witness in the case. Thus, in an unusual procedural development in the lead-up to the March 2013 hearings, the tribunal expressed its own desire to hear from Mr Kolomoisky and thus asked the parties “to use their best efforts to secure the appearance and testimony” of Mr. Kolomoisky and another individual. Ultimately, Mr Kolomoisky appeared and gave testimony in the case.)
