High Court holds defrauded party to lower standard of due diligence   The claimants argued that Kazakhstan should have known, at the time of the arbitration, of its link with Perkwood. Indeed, Kazakhstan had already aired several allegations of fraud regarding Perkwood during the arbitral proceedings, such as that the claimants had siphoned money from the state through its transactions with Perkwood, or that they had tried to mislead potential investors with respect to the economic viability of the LPG project. Such allegations, in the claimants’ view, should have led Kazakhstan to further question the links between Perkwood and the claimants and, ultimately, the soundness of Kazakhstan’s bid for acquiring the project.  However, the High Court accepted that defrauded parties should not be held to an overly high standard of diligence, holding that “the Claimants, if dishonest, are not to escape if the right stone was not turned over by the State.” It mattered in this respect that the contracts with Perkwood that revealed the alleged fraud had not been disclosed in the arbitration, despite falling within the scope of the document production requests, and that the claimants resisted until the Swedish set aside proceedings to concede their links with Perkwood. As a result, the state will be allowed to rely on evidence it obtained since the end of the arbitration proceedings in the later trial.
