Venezuela’s denunciation of the ICSID Convention figures prominently in the debates   Readers will recall that Venezuela denounced the ICSID Convention in January 2012; under article 71 of the Convention, this withdrawal became effective six months later on July 25, 2012. (Blue Bank’s was one of the nine requests filed with ICSID following Venezuela’s denunciation of the Convention.)  Venezuela claimed that there was no consent to arbitration available when Blue Bank filed for arbitration with ICSID in June 2012, because the denunciation occurred in January. Alternatively, if the tribunal were to consider that there was still consent until July 2012, this would not save Blue Bank’s claims, because the request was registered by the ICSID Secretariat only in August.  The claimant insisted that Venezuela had given its unconditional consent to arbitration under ICSID in the BIT, and this treaty remained in force and was unaffected by the denunciation of ICSID. In any case, the claimant stressed that the request was sent before the denunciation became effective, per article 71.
