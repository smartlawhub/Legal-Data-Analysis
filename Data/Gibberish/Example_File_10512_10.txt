Supreme Court finds that the PPA was subject to parliamentary approval   Although it refused to postpone or suspend the arbitral proceedings in deference to the proceedings in the Ghanaian courts, the tribunal indicated that it was ready to “arrange for an ample procedural calendar” so as to take account of the outcome of these proceedings.  Ghana’s Supreme Court issued its judgment on May 16, 2012, while the parties were still exchanging written pleadings in the arbitration case. Before remitting the matter to a lower court for judgment on the PPA’s validity, the Supreme Court found that the PPA was an “international business transaction” falling under article 181(5) of the Constitution.
