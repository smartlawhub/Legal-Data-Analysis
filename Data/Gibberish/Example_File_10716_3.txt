Investment treaties do not allow multiple claimants in a vertical ownership chain to claim for the same injury   Although the award does not make clear which argument swayed the tribunal, its reasoning in holding OTMTI’s claims inadmissible is coloured by Algeria’s objections – even those it found no need to answer.*  The tribunal’s reasoning started by stressing the similarities between the three notices of dispute: they all cited as grounds for the dispute the same measures and omissions by Algeria. They also referred to each other in defining the dispute, and they were all signed by Mr Sawiris.  For this reason, the tribunal concluded, all three notices referred to the same dispute, and this dispute had “crystallized” first via OTH’s 2010 notice of dispute. The tribunal explained that “[t]o the extent OTH would have restored its company value through arbitration proceedings under the BIT, all of the companies higher up in the corporate chain, including the Claimant, would have been made whole as well.”  This mattered in view of the “purpose of investment treaty arbitration,” which was to fully repair injuries to investors; if one investor in a chain of ownership is made whole, “the claims brought by other members of the vertical chain in other arbitral proceedings may become inadmissible depending on the circumstances.” (The tribunal did not elaborate on how it derived this “purpose of investment treaty arbitration.”)  The question was thus whether OTMTI was claiming any loss that was not already repaired.
