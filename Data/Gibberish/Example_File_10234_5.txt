Tribunal adopts investors’ suggested “country risk” premium, as well as a “size” premium   The tribunal also had to mediate disagreements among the experts with respect to certain DCF analysis inputs.  The parties disagreed with respect to the country risk premium, an element about which arbitrators have often differed in the past . While Venezuela’s expert advocated the same rate of 14.75% adopted by the tribunal in Tidewater v. Venezuela , the investors settled on a much more modest 4.6%.  The tribunal chose not to opine at length on the debate over country risk premia. Instead, the tribunal held that Venezuela’s expert did not specify or further explain what factors would justify the higher rate of 14.75%, and thus preferred to adopt the investors’ suggested rate of 4.6%.  The parties also sparred over the use, and, if so, the proper level, of an adjusted beta in determining the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) (i.e., the discount rate). The investors advocated a “reversion-to-one” adjustment to the gross beta,* while Venezuela adopted a beta adjusted with reference to the companies’ peer group. As the tribunal found that the “reversion-to-one” adjustment was unwarranted in this case, it eventually opted for Venezuela’s beta.  A final point of contention between the parties was the use of a “size premium” in determining the WACC, to take into account the smaller size of Tavsa and Comsigua as compared to comparable entities. In this respect, the tribunal followed Venezuela in adopting such “size premium”, reasoning that Tavsa and Comsigua, as smaller entities, had higher risks of liquidity crisis.
