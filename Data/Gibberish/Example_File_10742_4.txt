Umbrella clause not applicable to general legislation   Article 10(1)’s last sentence is an umbrella clause protecting “any obligations [the host State] has entered into with an Investor.”  While the claimant contended that this covered the remuneration systems under which it invested, the tribunal disagreed, laying stress on the words “entered into.” For the tribunal, this wording indicated without ambiguity that only specific commitments between states and investors, and not general regulatory acts applying to foreign and domestic investors alike, should fall under the umbrella clause.  While the tribunal saw exceptions for legislation directed explicitly to foreign investors, as in Liman v Kazakhstan , this was not the case here, given that the FiT regime was directed to all investors – and Isolux’s own plants had been first built by its Spanish (i.e. non-foreign) parent, ISOLUX.  (Interestingly, the Isolux case can be contrasted with Micula v Romania, where a majority of the tribunal held that, although general commitments were probably not covered by umbrella clauses, “crystallised” or “vested” entitlements should be covered. This tribunal stressed that the investors in that case had been granted an “investor certificate” that qualified them to receive the scheme of incentives at stake in that case (see here ). Similarly, Isolux’s assets had to be formally registered in order to benefit from the FiT system.)
