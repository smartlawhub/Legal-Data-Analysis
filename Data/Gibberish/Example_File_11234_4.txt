Tribunal seems not to see a denial of justice, without explicitly clarifying on what basis it was examining that obligation   On the facts, and despite all the improprieties identified (see our companion report ), the tribunal was not convinced that there had been a denial of justice by Ukraine’s courts, at least from a procedural point of view and as this term is understood in customary international law. The tribunal noted that the “courts have been generally available to the affected parties,” and “mere errors of fact or law on the part of the domestic courts do not breach the standard of denial of justice.” In this particular context, the tribunal also observed that discrimination on the basis of nationality was not established by the evidence either.  (As explained below, the tribunal did flag a different form of discrimination: a favouring of one set of shareholder interests in Ukrtatnafta. This analysis took place in the context of the tribunal’s FET analysis, seemingly implying that narrower nationality-based discrimination is relevant for the customary-law standard of denial of justice, while the more capacious FET standard can catch other sorts of discrimination.)
