Further challenges to the claimants’ investment are rejected   Uzbekistan further argued that the claimants’ investment was not a protected “investment” under the BIT’s definition.  In this context, the tribunal first rejected the argument that investments financed by a loan do not deserve protection under the BIT. The tribunal found that “[i]t is not at all unusual for investments to entail the use of credit facilities by investors”. A further (undetailed) allegation that the loan was an improper, “related-party transaction” designed to defraud the Kazakh Sovereign Wealth Fund was rejected as unproven.  The respondent also took issue with the claimants’ avowed intent to sell their investment. Short-term investment, Uzbekistan argued, are not protected under the BIT. But the tribunal disagreed, finding that no such restriction could be read in the BIT. Although there are circumstances where “short-term” investment might be denied protection (such as “where investors in a stock exchange briefly hold shares in an undertaking, in the midst of buying and selling”), the circumstances in the case were different and the claimants’ investment in BC and KC were covered by the treaty.
