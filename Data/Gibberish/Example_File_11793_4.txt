Claimant can only prove “disagreement” with tribunal’s interpretation of “procurement,” insufficient for set aside purposes   Mesa Power’s first argument before the Court related to the tribunal’s interpretation of the term “procurement” in NAFTA’s Chapter 11. This interpretation led the majority to dismiss Mesa Power’s discrimination and MFN claims.  The tribunal, the claimant contended, had ignored the definition of “procurement” in other NAFTA chapters, and therefore erred in interpreting the term as it stands in Chapter 11. (In this respect, Mesa Power’s argument followed closely the dissenting opinion of Mr Brower in the case, which we’ve reviewed here .)  Rather than engaging in this interpretative dispute, the Court noted that the tribunal’s analysis did not cross the line between an (allegedly) mistaken, text-based interpretation and “something else.” The DC Court noted that the “tribunal employed all of the standard interpretative tools that a court or arbitration panel would normally use”. The Court found support for this conclusion in the fact that the dissenting arbitrator used the same tools to reach a different conclusion.  For the Court, then, Mesa Power’s challenge to the tribunal’s interpretation was in the nature of a mere disagreement with the conclusion reached. As the standard of review to set aside an award requires more than a mistaken interpretation, Mesa Power’s first argument failed.
