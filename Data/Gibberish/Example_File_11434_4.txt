Majority finds that Venezuela’s consent to arbitration, under article 71, lasted until July 2012   The three members of the tribunal concluded in favour of the claimant, although the president took a somewhat different route, as explained in his separate opinion (see below).  The majority agreed with the earlier tribunal in Venoklim v Venezuela (see here ) that the relevant date for establishing jurisdiction was the date of the request – and not the date of the claim’s registration. Indeed, the latter depends on the ICSID secretariat, and “a claimant should not be prejudiced in its filing of a request of arbitration for any delays that may accrue in connection with the registration.”  The request was thus filed in June in a timely manner; the ICSID Secretariat then posed questions about the claimant’s corporate authority to file the request. Although the claimant resolved these concerns only on July 27, 2012, this did not prejudice the claimant’s position.  Ultimately, the majority reasoned that an effet utile interpretation of article 71 meant that Venezuela’s consent to arbitration endured for six months following the notice of denunciation – and that the claimant’s June request was thus lodged in time. As a result, the tribunal had jurisdiction ratione voluntatis over the claim.
