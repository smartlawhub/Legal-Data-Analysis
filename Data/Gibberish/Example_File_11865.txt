 Arbitrators express doubts about a right to security for costs, but bankrupt claimant’s “after-the-event” insurance policy obviates any need to rule definitively

 Following Italy’s failed attempt at summarily dismissing the Eskosol case, a decision on provisional measures dated April 12, 2017 has recently been released by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes [

  As we explain in our report
 </a>
 on the summary dismissal proceedings, the case concerns investments in a solar power plant in Italy. Eskosol, a local Italian company who owns the plant, is under receivership and brought an ICSID claim under the Energy Charter Treaty, independently of a parallel claim initiated by Eskosol’s former majority shareholder, Blusun (for our recent review of the recently-published Blusun award, see

 ).
</p>
<p>
 The Eskosol procedural order reveals that Italy made a request for provisional measures of protection on January 18, 2017, seeking information about Eskosol’s funding arrangements, and Italy asked for security for costs.
</p>
<p>
 As we discuss below, the tribunal of

 Winston &amp; Strawn act for Eskosol in these proceedings, while Italy rely on in-house counsel.

 <strong>
  Italy suspects existence of litigation funding and seeks security for costs
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Italy’s suspicions that Eskosol was receiving litigation funding arose after realising that the claimant had failed to put into the ICSID record part of the Italian bankruptcy court’s resolution authorising the receiver to start the ICSID arbitration. The omitted passages of the resolution suggested that the arbitration would not be a financial burden for Eskosol. The claimant later confirmed the existence of a third-party funding arrangement.
</p>
<p>
 Italy thus asked the tribunal to order Eskosol to post funds – around €250,000 – that would serve as security for costs, were Eskosol’s claims to fail. Italy relied on the case of
 <a href="http://www.iareporter.com/articles/icsid-tribunal-orders-serial-claimant-to-post-security-for-costs-in-st-lucia-case-but-also-opens-third-party-funding-can-of-worms/">
  RSM v Saint Lucia
 </a>
 , to this day the only known investment arbitration case in which a tribunal has acceded to such a request. In Italy’s view, Eskosol’s bankruptcy, as well as its reliance on litigation funding, indicated that the risks of non-compliance with an adverse award on costs were “material and serious.”
</p>
<p>
 Alternatively, Italy asked the tribunal to direct Eskosol to obtain a binding commitment from the funder that any adverse costs order would be paid.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Eskosol sees no power to order security for costs, and stressed that it has an insurance policy to cover adverse arbitration costs
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Eskosol, for its part, contested the power of the tribunal to order security for costs, and explained that Italy had no “right
 <em>
  per se
 </em>
 to be awarded its costs here” any such right was speculative and could not ground Italy’s provisional request. The claimant also stressed that Italy’s request was mostly based upon the fact that Eskosol is in a situation of bankruptcy; as this bankruptcy was (allegedly) the result of Italy’s wrongful acts to begin with, the claimant decried Italy’s attempt to “benefit from its own misconduct.”
</p>
<p>
 In any case, the claimant revealed that it has obtained an after-the-event (ATE) insurance policy that would cover adverse costs up to a total of €1million. In the claimant’s view, this deprived Italy’s request of any relevance.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Tribunal casts doubt over “right” to collect costs award, and denies Italy’s request
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 In its recent order, the tribunal questioned the analysis of the earlier RSM v Saint Lucia tribunal, pointing out that the state’s putative right at the basis of such a security-for-costs request is
 <em>
  not
 </em>
 a right to claim reimbursement for such costs (as this right would be unaffected by the presence or absence of assets) – but rather a right to
 <em>
  effective
 </em>
 relief in case costs are awarded to a party at the conclusion of the arbitration.
</p>
<p>
 The tribunal acknowledged that states might well be concerned about the enforcement of costs awards in their favour, but would (presumably) “be unhappy to see a similar argument about a right to effective relief used against them.”
</p>
<p>
 The tribunal deemed the issue here to be related to
 <em>
  collection
 </em>
 of any compensation granted in an award, and on this question the ICSID Convention reserves the “execution of the award” to national laws. For the tribunal, “there is something analytically curious about the notion that an ICSID tribunal, while not empowered to protect a claimant’s ability to collect on a possible merits award, nonetheless should intervene to protect a State’s asserted “right” to collect on a possible costs award.”
</p>
<p>
 Without taking a final position in this debate, the tribunal cited
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/articles/in-new-ruling-bit-tribunal-holds-that-alleged-right-to-future-costs-recovery-is-not-a-right-capable-of-grounding-an-interim-security-for-costs-request/">
  <em>

  report

 of the (still unpublished) decision in Valle Verde v Venezuela for the conclusion that the right claimed by Italy does not exist, while noting at the same time that other tribunals (such as EuroGas v Slovakia, see
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/articles/icsid-tribunal-orders-identification-of-third-party-funder-but-denies-states-request-for-security-for-costs-and-claimants-request-for-provisional-measures/">

 </a>
 ) have found the opposite.
</p>
<p>
 In any event, these tribunals also held that security for costs should only be granted in exceptional circumstances. On the facts in this case, the Eskosol tribunal was not convinced that the case’s circumstances warranted the measures sought by Italy, particularly given that Eskosol ATE’s insurance policy was there to assuage Italy’s concerns.
</p>
<p>
 Moreover, the tribunal doubted that Italy’s request would be proportional given Eskosol’s likely difficulties in collecting the funds. “A tribunal should not lightly recommend a provisional measure that could impede access to justice,” the award reads.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Disclosure application also rejected
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Italy also asked the tribunal to direct the claimant to confirm it relies on a third-party funder, and, in the affirmative, to disclose “whether such third party would be financially sound as well as committed to execute a cost award.” Italy relied on the precedent in Muhammet Çap &amp; al. v Turkmenistan in making this request (see
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/articles/in-an-apparent-first-icsid-tribunal-orders-claimants-to-disclose-any-third-party-litigation-funders-backing-their-arbitration/">
  here
 </a>
 ).
</p>
<p>
 However, the tribunal found that this request was moot now that Eskosol has admitted the existence of litigation funding arrangements sufficient to cover any costs award at that point.
</p>
<p>
 (The award does not record whether Italy also asked for disclosure of the funder’s name to verify the inexistence of conflicts of interests. This “transparency” motive for disclosure has previously found favour with the Muhammet Çap, EuroGas and

 </a>
 tribunals.)
</p>
<p>
 The provisional measures request was thus dismissed, and costs reserved for later.
