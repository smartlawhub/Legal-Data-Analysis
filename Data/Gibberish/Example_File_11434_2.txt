Burden of proof for jurisdictional facts lies with the claimant   As a preliminary matter, the parties sparred over who had the burden of proof in jurisdictional proceedings. Blue Bank argued that it only had to present a prima facie factual evidence that the tribunal had jurisdiction, and the burden then shifted to Venezuela to refute this evidence.  However, the tribunal proposed that a distinction be made between facts that have relevance for the jurisdictional issue, and those that are relevant for the merits of the case. The tribunal agreed that the latter could be accepted prima facie , because they would be fully reviewed on the merits. But the former set of facts had to be fully proven at the jurisdictional phase, as argued by Venezuela. This placed the burden of proof on the claimant.
