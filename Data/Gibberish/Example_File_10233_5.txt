Romania partially paid the award    As we previously reported , Romania contended at various times during enforcement proceedings in the US that it had already paid the award in full. This payment was allegedly made by way of a set-off against some taxes owed by the investors. In its effort to set aside the award’s registration, Romania seemingly reiterated this claim before Mr Justice Blair, albeit succinctly (the judgment records that the Commission did “not take a position” on this issue).  The High Court’s judgment offers a clearer picture of the factual record. It reveals that, in addition to a partial early payment, Romania sought to offset the award against taxes owed by one of the claimants’ corporate entities in Romania. However, this set-off was successfully contested by the claimants before the Romanian courts. At the time of judgment, the Romanian Supreme Court was still considering the question. Other payment efforts by Romania were thwarted by the Final Decision.  As a result, the judgment dismissed Romania’s effort to set aside the award’s registration on this ground, as it remained unpaid for the most part.
