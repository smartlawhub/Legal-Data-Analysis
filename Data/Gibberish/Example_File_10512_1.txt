In now-public award, arbitrators interpret Ghana’s constitution and disagree with Supreme Court’s reading of key provision; gov’t is estopped from arguing that contract is invalid due to lack of parliamentary approval    A petition registered on Friday with the US District Court for the District of Columbia casts light on an arbitral award obtained in 2014 by a foreign-owned* investor against the Republic of Ghana.  The underlying dispute arose from a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with British energy investor Balkan Energy and its Ghanaian subsidiary (both wholly-owned subsidiaries of US companies).  Despite the contractual nature of the claim, the awards disclosed with the petition display some hallmarks of investment-treaty arbitration. Starting with the arbitrators: Arbitrator 
   chaired a tribunal composed of Arbitrator 
   and Thomas Mensah.** Under the PPA’s arbitration clause, the Permanent Court of Arbitration was administering the case.  Below, we report on the fate of Ghana’s sole jurisdictional objection: that the PPA was void due to parliamentary approval never having been granted.  As we indicate, the tribunal would offer its own reading of Ghana’s constitution – departing from the view taken by the country’s Supreme Court – and held that the state could not escape its obligations merely due to the underlying contract not having been submitted for parliamentary approval.
