 In a rare move, after arbitrators decline jurisdiction over dispute, investor’s home state courts rule that they will adjudicate claims for breach of bilateral investment treaty

</p>
<p>
 In a rare instance of a claim for breach of a bilateral investment treaty being litigated in a domestic court, the Spanish courts appear set to hear a case brought by an aggrieved Spanish investor against Equatorial Guinea.
</p>
<p>
 Recently, a Madrid appeal court overturned the findings of a lower judge who held that the Spanish construction company Grupo Francisco Hernando Contreras SL (GFHC) could not submit its dispute with Equatorial Guinea to the Spanish courts (judgment available
 <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.es/search/contenidos.action?action=contentpdf&amp;databasematch=AN&amp;reference=8074532&amp;links=arbitraje&amp;optimize=20170627&amp;publicinterface=true">

 </a>
 , in Spanish).
</p>
<p>
 The court found that the Equatorial Guinea-Spain Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) was applicable to the case, including with respect to unrealized investments (the treaty also mentions “promotion” of investments).
</p>
<p>
 The court also ruled that Spanish courts have jurisdiction over the case, even though the various jurisdictional options listed in the BIT do not explicitly provide for settlement by the courts of the investor’s home state. For the Madrid court, the BIT merely offers a non-exhaustive list of options to the investor, and in any case, now that an ICSID arbitration has been dismissed on jurisdictional grounds (see further below), GFHC should be free to try its luck with domestic courts (raising some question as to whether the investor is being afforded ‘two bites at the apple’ in its bid to sue Equatorial Guinea).
</p>
<p>
 Since the Spanish courts have not yet grappled with the merits of the case, we will report in more detail on those developments as they unfold. Meanwhile, we analyze the earlier ICSID award in more detail below. (

 </a>
 (Equatorial Guinea’s appointee),* is notable in that it saw a majority of the tribunal decline jurisdiction after finding that the claimant made no investment in Equatorial Guinea had failed to enter a proper contract with the state; this despite having incurred substantial pre-contractual expenditures. This reasoning was strongly contested in the dissenting opinion of Mr Orrego Vicuña.
</p>
<p>
 Both parties were represented by their own in-house teams, as well as Madrid-based José Merino Jiménez for the claimant, and lawyers from domestic law firm T&amp;E for Equatorial Guinea.**

 <strong>
  Development project fails to take off
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 The dispute finds its roots in a 2008 project to develop a large set of buildings, facilities and accommodations in Malabo and Bata (two of Equatorial Guinea’s main cities). In view of this project, the claimant and officials signed a letter of intention in January 2008, before signing several agreements providing for the constitution of a joint company in late 2008. However, the procurement contract contemplated in these agreements failed to materialise and the project never got off the ground.
</p>
<p>
 Despite these difficulties, GFHC won a bid in 2011 for another development project in the city of Oyala. However, again, the project failed to materialize, following the granting of the concession to the claimant
</p>
<p>
 The claimant sent its notice of dispute in 2012, later opting for an arbitration under ICSID’s Additional Facility Rules. The final Award on Jurisdiction is dated December 4, 2015, and is available
 <a href="https://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/italaw7106.pdf">
  here
 </a>
 (as explained below, the tribunal signed the award earlier that year).
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  BIT is the applicable law
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 As an introduction to its analysis, the tribunal addressed the parties’ disagreement as to the law applicable to the question of jurisdiction. Equatorial Guinea argued that its domestic laws were solely applicable; the claimant pointed to the BIT.
</p>
<p>
 The tribunal sided with the claimant, observing that, to follow Equatorial Guinea’s reasoning would entail that the jurisdiction of international tribunals constituted under the BIT could be subject to, and indeed possibly denied by, domestic laws – a situation in which international arbitration would lose its effectiveness. Equatorial Guinean law could still be relevant, the tribunal allowed, but only where the BIT explicitly refers to it.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Tribunal adopts Salini test for investment
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 While the tribunal had no difficulty finding that GFHC was a national of Spain for the purposes of the BIT, its status as an “investor” depended on the existence of an investment in Equatorial Guinea. Likewise, the tribunal’s jurisdiction under ICSID’s Additional Facility Rules required that the dispute arose directly from an investment.
</p>
<p>
 The arbitrators observed that investment case law progressively adopted the “interpretative framework” commonly described as the “Salini test,” which requires that an investment comprise a contribution, have a certain duration, and an element of risk. The tribunal also interpreted the BIT so that investments should be made in accordance with the laws of Equatorial Guinea.
</p>
<p>
 The tribunal noted that the parties primarily debated the existence of a contribution arising under a contractual framework and in accordance with domestic law.
</p>
<p>
 For a majority of the tribunal, its jurisdiction thus hinged on the existence of a valid contractual basis as an “essential prerequisite” to this jurisdiction. As we explain below, the majority found that none existed.
</p>
<p>
 (The tribunal did not seem to have answered the claimant’s more minor contention that it also had intellectual property rights derived from its elaboration of the projects. A similar claim had been made – and also left unanswered – in
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/articles/in-depth-ickale-tribunal-treats-construction-contracts-as-investments-but-finds-no-expropriation-in-state-commercial-conduct-while-dissenter-criticises-disproportionate-measures/">
  Ickale v. Turkmenistan
 </a>
 , leaving unclear the status of such “intellectual property rights” in relation to construction projects.)
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Pre-contracts are not contracts, and pre-contractual expenditures do not qualify without a contract
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Pressed to point to its contribution to the alleged investment, GFHC stressed that, on the basis of the contracts with the state, it had disbursed funds to study and elaborate on the project, acquired machines in Spain, ordered technical studies from consultancies, and subcontracted with third parties for some minor works before the dispute arose.
</p>
<p>
 In addition, GFHC had created a domestic company named Nueva Edificación for the purposes of the project, together with the joint company, INCOGESA (of which both CFHC and the government had an equal share).
</p>
<p>
 However, the majority noted that according to the Letter of Intention signed by the parties, as well as the agreements regarding the constitution of INCOGESA, the project itself, and particularly its costs, required approbation from the government. The agreements themselves were predicated on conditions (notably obtaining a contract from the government) which, the majority found, were not met by the claimant.
</p>
<p>
 In this view, there was then no contract with the government that would justify the claimant’s expenditures on machines and subcontractors, and qualify them as investments under the BIT.***
</p>
<p>
 Although the majority focused on the “contribution” element of the Salini test, it also later clarified that the “risk” should be the one entailed in the investment itself, not the “mere lost opportunity” of investing in the first place.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Domestic law requires specific government approval of procurement contract
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 The majority confirmed this analysis by finding that the whole investment operation failed to comply with domestic law.
</p>
<p>
 Indeed, the tribunal noted that the law governing procurement contracts in Equatorial Guinea required, for the type of contract at stake in the case, compliance with a “technical and administrative process” that GFHC failed to prove was followed for its investment.
</p>
<p>
 The claimant did not deny this, but argued that the silence from the administration, when it tried to validate the project with it, amounted to an agreement under Guinean law. The majority however noted that this administrative rule applied only in normal administrative proceedings, whereas the law on procurement contracts provided for a special procedure. As a result, silence was no agreement here, which meant that there was no contract between the parties.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Dissolved company is not an investment in compliance with domestic laws
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Equatorial Guinea also claimed that the constitution of Nueva Edificación was invalid as per its laws, and notably because the claimant eventually withdrew the funds posted for Nueva Edificación’s social capital. As the latter fell below the mandatory minimum, this meant that Nueva Edificación was automatically in a state of dissolution.
</p>
<p>
 The claimant argued that this was irrelevant for the jurisdiction of the tribunal, as Nueva Edificación had been validly constituted in the first place, even for a fleeting time. The raid on the funds, GFHC explained, was a precautionary measure pending an imminent expropriation.
</p>
<p>
 The majority however accepted that under the applicable law (the OHADA Uniform Act relating to trading companies and economic interest groups), Nueva Edificación had indeed been dissolved in the absence of sufficient funds. “A company that finds itself in a state of latent dissolution can hardly be recognised as a company that fully exists […],” the majority noted, before observing that it saw no evidence of a risk of expropriation at the time.
</p>
<p>
 As for INCOGESA, the state noted that its articles of association made no mention of the bank account where its capital was supposed to be posted by the shareholders (i.e., GFHC and the government), or indeed of the outlay of this capital from any of the parties. GFHC answered that INCOGESA was not governed by the Uniform Act, and no other legal provision predicated a joint company’s valid constitution on the contribution to its capital.
</p>
<p>
 The majority disagreed, finding the Uniform Act applicable. As there was no indication whether or where INCOGESA’s capital had been posted by either party, its constitution was also invalid.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Majority chastises negligent claimant
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 For the majority, invalidly constituted companies could not contract with the government, meaning that there was no jurisdictional basis in this case as far as the two companies were concerned.
</p>
<p>
 In a few strongly-worded sentences, the majority deplored the claimant’s lack of “adequate knowledge of the domestic law applicable to the alleged investment,” and saw in the “failure of diligence” the work of a “negligent shareholder.” It also looked dimly on the claimant’s contention that Equatorial Guinea should have told it of the required steps to take in accordance with domestic law.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Inactive investor cannot benefit from unperfected adjudication process
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 GFHC also failed to prove that it had a qualifying investment in the Oyala project, as the majority found that to be considered an investment for jurisdictional purposes, the constitution of the company should have been followed, –per Equatorial Guinean law – by the signing of a contract in following thirty days.
</p>
<p>
 The majority found no trace of such a contract or constitution of the company was published in the official journal, in accordance with procurement law. Since there was no evidence that the claimant had sought to sign the contract, or otherwise insisted on the perfection of the constitution process, the majority held that GFHC had renounced its right and was “uninterested” in investing in the Oyala project. Accordingly, there was no investment there either.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Dissenter would have seen a contract
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 In a dissenting opinion, arbitrator
 <a href="http://www.iareporter.com/arbitrator/Orrego-Vicuna">
  Francisco Orrego Vicuña
 </a>
 explained that, contrary to findings of the majority, a contract existed in the case. Of course, the dissenter said, if the question is whether there existed an instrument solemnly denominated “contract,” the answer was no – but civil law allows for informal contracts when there is coincidence of the parties’ wills.
</p>
<p>
 And in this respect, the dissenter saw a contract in the various agreements and instruments adopted by the parties, the provisions of which went much further than would require a mere declaration of intention. That the domestic companies eventually faltered did not mean, according to the dissenter, that they were unable to constitute an investment – especially when the facts underlying these failures are exactly what the tribunal was called upon to determine. For example, although GFHC did not contribute the required capital to INCOGESA, this could be explained by the political “uncertainty” prevailing at the time – indeed by the very “risk” the majority thought did not sufficiently exist here.
</p>
<p>
 The dissenter also rejected the majority’s view that the investor ought to have known domestic law better, and stressed that, in cases where an investor deals with the government directly, the latter would have an obligation to ensure that domestic processes and laws are complied with.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Arbitrators disagreed on costs
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 The majority decided to split all costs, but since Equatorial Guinea had failed to make one advance payment to the proceedings, it was ordered to pay the claimant half the missing payment.
</p>
<p>
 Although the dissent and the award were first signed by the parties in later July 2015, the dissenter signed an addendum to his opinion in November 2015, explaining that he would have had Equatorial Guinea paying all costs, for failure to comply with the tribunal orders and for providing false information. The majority shortly replied with a “clarification” that stressed that there was no evidence of procedural misconduct on Equatorial Guinea’s part, and repeated that costs were split equally.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
 * A small complication arose in 2014 when Mr Vinuesa disclosed that he had Spanish nationality, in addition to his Argentinian nationality. While Equatorial Guinea declared that it reserved its rights to seek an annulment of the award on this basis, the matter was eventually laid to rest.
</p>
<p>
 ** The case displayed high instability in terms of the parties’ counsel. The Spanish law firm De Castro Morenilla originally assisted the claimant in the proceedings, but was discharged after little more than a year in the case.
</p>
<p>
 As for Equatorial Guinea’s defence, Foley &amp; Hoag, LLP was originally retained, but withdrew shortly after the tribunal had been constituted. Its replacement, Greenberg Traurig LLP, was discharged little more than a year later, and one day after the rejoinder penned by the law firm was submitted by Equatorial Guinea. At the claimant’s suggestion, the state shortly withdrew this rejoinder from the record.
</p>
<p>
 *** The question of the status of such “pre-investment” expenditures has puzzled some tribunals in the past.
