Tribunal rejects new claim, and values Tavsa at $112 million   With respect to Tavsa’s own valuation, the tribunal sided with Venezuela’s experts regarding the company’s expected production levels, observing that production never reached the alleged level (90% of its production capacity) relied upon by the investors; although Tenaris’s expert had blamed labour conflicts for this outcome, the tribunal held that the impact of such conflicts on production was unproven.  As for Tavsa’s costs , the parties debated the importance of technical assistance contracts that, prior to the expropriation, bound Tavsa and Tamsa, Tenaris’s wholly-owned Mexican branch (and Tavsa’s direct parent). The investors contended that Tavsa became self-sufficient in 2008 and did not need to contract for further technical assistance in the future.  However, the tribunal found this hypothesis unconvincing, and accepted Venezuela’s suggestion that this assistance’s expected cost should enter the DCF analysis.  Providing for this outcome, Tenaris’s experts proposed alternatively that Tamsa should be compensated for this loss, as it would have likely remained Tavsa’s provider of technical assistance absent the expropriation. However, the arbitrators rejected this claim, stressing that they could not rule on a claim in excess of what the parties sought in their request to arbitration and further submissions (where there was no mention of such claim).  Applying all these factors to the DCF model used by the parties, the tribunal arrived at a value of around $112 million for Tavsa.  The tribunal was satisfied that this figure comported with valuations reached by alternative valuation methods: specifically using market multiples. (Although the tribunal eventually remained silent on the appropriateness of a “control premium” entering such analysis, readers will recall that the tribunal in Crystallex v. Venezuela refused to apply such premium.)
