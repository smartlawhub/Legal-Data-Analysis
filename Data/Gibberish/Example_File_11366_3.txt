Claimants ask for “emergency temporary provisional measures,” citing risks of insolvency following tax and antifraud investigations by Romanian authorities   As Romania was responding to the claimants’ first request for provisional measures, the tribunal received a second request for provisional measures, and a related request for “emergency temporary provisional measures” pending the resolution of this second request (dated July 28, 2016).  This new request concerned two investigations concerning RMGC, launched and pursued by agencies of Romania’s Ministry of Finance, which represents Romania in the arbitral proceedings. One investigation is pursued by the Antifraud Directorate; the other by the Tax Directorate, and resulted in a Value Added Tax (VAT) assessment that claimed $6.7 million of VAT liability from RMGC.  The claimants argued that both investigations were in retaliation for the filing of this arbitration and, citing the need to ensure the procedural integrity of the ICSID case, sought measures to prevent Romania from aggravating the dispute or from benefitting from the documents and information obtained as the result of these investigations.  Notably, the claimants underlined that the enforcement of the VAT liability threatened to push RMGC into insolvency, a development which would definitely deprive them of their investment and prevent further access to the project company’s books and records.  To postpone such enforcement and challenge the tax investigation before Romanian courts, the claimants would have to post a guarantee long before any decision could be taken by the arbitral tribunal on these questions. (Readers may recall that Gabriel Resources is a sole-asset company, whose arbitration has been funded against a share of the eventual compensation, if any is awarded by the tribunal.) Accordingly, the claimants sought emergency temporary provisional measures to preserve the status quo while the tribunal examined this second request.*
