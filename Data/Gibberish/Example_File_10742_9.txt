No retroactivity in immediate application   The tribunal also gave short shrift to the claimantâ€™s argument that the new remuneration system was retroactive, as it took into account rates of return previously achieved by the plants built under the special regime to assess the remuneration owed under the new system.  Citing the case of Nations Energy v Panama (in which Mr. von Wobeser sat, see here ), the tribunal distinguished retroactivity and immediate application of a new legal provision. The new Spanish regime was of immediate effect and departed from the original regime, but it did not annul nor reverse the effects of the original regime for the claimant at the time this regime was in force.
