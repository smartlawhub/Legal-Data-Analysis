No confidentiality obligation in NAFTA arbitral proceedings   The early proceedings were characterized by multiple skirmishes between the parties over the secrecy of the proceedings. Mondev objected to the disclosure of the case’s documents by the respondent, and notably also to the disclosure of some documents sought by third parties under the USA’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The respondent countered that there was no confidentiality requirement under NAFTA Chapter 11, and that it had to comply with the FOIA.  These contentions culminated in several orders and preliminary decisions between September 2000 and February 2001, which are briefly related in the Award. The tribunal concluded that it could not prohibit the US from releasing the documents pursuant to its statutory obligation under the FOIA, and agreed that the NAFTA contained no obligation of confidentiality.  However, in view of the arbitration rules, the tribunal also ordered the parties to treat as confidential any other document not subject to such FOIA requests until the conclusion of the proceedings.  Some months later, the NAFTA’s Free Trade Commission’s issued Notes (available here ) that touched on the confidentiality issue. Although these Notes are more famous for their interpretation of NAFTA’s article 1105 (see below), they also confirmed that NAFTA contains no obligation of confidentiality, and embodied the NAFTA parties’ agreement to “make available to the public, in a timely manner, all documents” in NAFTA arbitrations (subject to the redaction of some confidential details).
