Majority chastises negligent claimant   For the majority, invalidly constituted companies could not contract with the government, meaning that there was no jurisdictional basis in this case as far as the two companies were concerned.  In a few strongly-worded sentences, the majority deplored the claimant’s lack of “adequate knowledge of the domestic law applicable to the alleged investment,” and saw in the “failure of diligence” the work of a “negligent shareholder.” It also looked dimly on the claimant’s contention that Equatorial Guinea should have told it of the required steps to take in accordance with domestic law.
