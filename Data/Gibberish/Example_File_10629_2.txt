Jurisdiction should be appreciated as at the start of the proceedings   Argentina’s central objection* to the tribunal’s jurisdiction was that Vivendi was no longer the direct, majority shareholder at the time of the proceedings. Argentina contended that a succession of corporate restructuring saw the claimant shed most of its participation in its Argentine subsidiary CAA, to the extent that it resubmitted the claim as a minority, indirect shareholder only. For the state, Vivendi’s amounted to a derivative claim, prohibited under international and Argentinian laws.  In answer, the tribunal stressed that its jurisdiction over the claimant’s case should be appreciated at the date when the proceedings were instituted. “The consequence of this rule is that,” the tribunal said, “once established, jurisdiction cannot be defeated. It simply is not affected by subsequent events”, including Vivendi’s restructurings.  Besides, the tribunal said, its findings were bound by the un-annulled conclusions of the first tribunal on jurisdiction, which were res judicata . The tribunal disagreed that the corporate changes pointed out by the respondent amounted to “new facts” that could defeat the res judicata effects of the first award.  Lastly, on the facts, the tribunal found that Vivendi actually remained at all times majority shareholder in CAA, so that there was identity of parties and claims with the first case. Since Vivendi was still the majority shareholder, the tribunal also dismissed Argentina’s argument that Vivendi’s was a derivative claim (nonetheless, the tribunal added that minority shareholders were anyway allowed to bring claims under the treaties).
