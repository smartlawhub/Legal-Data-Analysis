Tribunal should consider treaty claims   Argentina’s last objection was that the annulment proceedings had left only one claim on the tribunal’s table: that the Tucumán authorities conspired to frustrate the Concession Agreement. Argentina interpreted the ad hoc committee’s decision to the effect that all of Vivendi’s claims pertaining to the contract itself were out of reach for the tribunal.  The arbitrators held this as a misconstruction of the record, one which entailed the same error that had led the first award to be partially annulled. On the contrary, the tribunal said, all claims should be considered, but as possible treaty claims; whether they also constituted contractual breaches had no bearing on the tribunal’s task. ( As we reported , the claimant’s counsel, Arbitrator 
   , later chaired a tribunal – in SGS v. Paraguay – that took lessons from the Vivendi saga in holding that a tribunal needed “very strong cause” to refuse to exercise the jurisdiction it has.)
