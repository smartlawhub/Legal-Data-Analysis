  As we reported a few days ago
 </a>
 , an ICSID tribunal has put an end to Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris’ efforts to resort to international arbitration over past frictions with the Algerian authorities in relation to telecoms company Djezzy, which Mr Sawiris developed to become the leader in the Algerian mobile network market.

  We reported
 </a>
 on the beginnings of this dispute in 2012, when the claimant argued that harassment and mistreatment by the Algerian authorities had compelled it to sell its stake in Egyptian company Orascom Telecom Holding (OTH, Djezzy’s direct and majority shareholder) to Russian telecoms company VimpelCom at a loss.
</p>
<p>
 Notably, OTH (now controlled by VimpelCom) then filed its own UNCITRAL arbitration in 2012 under the Algeria-Egypt BIT. This latter case was
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/articles/resolution-of-algerian-telecoms-battle-quells-uncitral-arbitration-but-icsid-claim-by-former-owner-of-djezzy-will-continue/">
  suspended in 2014
 </a>
 , when VimpelCom agreed to sell a majority stake to Algeria.* The latest award reveals, however, that the OTH arbitration resumed in 2015, before being definitively settled in a March 12, 2015 consent award. As explained below, the relationship between the two arbitrations would be crucial in finding OTMTI’s claims inadmissible.

 White &amp; Case represented the claimant in these proceedings; Algeria was assisted by Shearman &amp; Sterling.

<p>
 <strong>
  Algeria contests the genuineness of OTMTI’s siège social
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 As a first step, the tribunal had to examine the meaning of the term “siège social” in the French-language Algeria-BLEU BIT’s definition of an “investor,” which includes “any legal person constituted in accordance with Belgian, Luxembourg or Algerian legislation and having its registered office [
 <em>
  siège social
 </em>
 ] in the territory of Belgium, Luxembourg or Algeria.” (This English text is based on an unofficial translation of the BIT filed with the UN.) This was essential for the tribunal’s jurisdiction
 <em>
  ratione personae
 </em>
 over OTMTI.
</p>
<p>
 Algeria interpreted “siège social” as different from “statutory seat,” and proposed that it referred instead to the “real seat,” the place or effective management – “the heart and the brain” – of the company’s operations. For Algeria, there was no doubt that OTMTI’s real seat was in Egypt, where Mr Sawiris and his team lived and worked, while the activity of the Management Board in Luxembourg had no real bearing on the company’s management.
</p>
<p>
 In particular, the parties sparred over the findings of the tribunal in the first Tenaris and Talta v. Venezuela case over the meaning of “siège social” in a similarly-worded Luxembourg BIT (see
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/articles/arbitrators-scrutinize-pre-arbitral-notice-duties-under-bit-and-requirements-that-claimants-corporate-seat-be-in-purported-home-country/">
  here
 </a>
 ), after the tribunal sought specific comments on the award. While Algeria endorsed this precedent, OTMTI found its findings on the award’s interpretation of
 <em>
  siège social
 </em>
 “erroneous.” (The award in the second Tenaris and Talta case, which we reviewed
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/articles/in-new-icsid-award-arbitrators-weigh-in-on-the-effects-of-venezuelas-denunciation-of-icsid-convention-and-then-find-the-state-liable-for-bit-breach/">
  here
 </a>
 , was issued after the OTMTI tribunal closed its proceedings, but came to the same conclusions as the first tribunal on this point.)
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Majority departs from precedent and identifies the customary international law roots of corporate nationality test
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 The tribunal recalled that, under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, it had jurisdiction over disputes brought by “nationals of a Contracting State.” However, the Convention left the definition of “nationality” for states to elaborate – as they did here in defining “investors” under the BIT.
</p>
<p>
 For a majority of the tribunal,** the term “siège social” should not be interpreted with reference to the criteria of corporate nationality under the domestic laws of the parties to the BIT, as was argued by Algeria. Rather, “siège social” had an autonomous meaning under the BIT, one disconnected from the use of this term in domestic settings.
</p>
<p>
 Readers will recall that both Tenaris and Talta tribunals, which found that “siège social” meant “effective seat,” had similarly played down the relevance of domestic laws in interpreting the term. However, the OTMTI tribunal ultimately found that “siège social” meant statutory seat (or “registered office”), and not “effective seat”.
</p>
<p>
 Dictionary definitions of the French and Dutch terms firstly supported this interpretation. More importantly, though, the majority explained that the first Tenaris and Talta tribunal had based its interpretation of “siège social” on the principle of
 <em>
  effet utile
 </em>
 : since the BIT’s definition requires that companies be constituted and have their “siège social” in one of the BIT’s contracting parties, the argument went, the second requirement would be redundant if “siège social” just meant statutory seat. (The first Tenaris and Talta tribunal also found support for this thesis in the BIT’s object and purpose.)
</p>
<p>
 The majority in OTMTI’s case disagreed with this analysis, finding that the BIT’s definition merely cited the two strands of the standard test to identify a corporate entity’s nationality under customary international law: constitution (in accordance with national law) and registered office (as appearing on the company’s constitutive documents).
</p>
<p>
 This double test had been endorsed, in particular, by the ICJ in Barcelona Traction: the Court saw in these two conditions the “traditional rule” for determining a corporate entity’s nationality. In the majority’s view, if the ICJ was not guilty of flouting the principle of
 <em>
  effet utile
 </em>
 in looking at both constitution and statutory seat, the BIT was not either.
</p>
<p>
 This conclusion was supported by supplementary means of interpretation under Article 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. While the Tenaris and Talta tribunal had found the BLEU’s treaty practice inconclusive, a focus on BLEU BITs that had been concluded in French
 <em>
  and
 </em>
 English (rather than on all BLEU BITs, as the Tenaris and Talta tribunal did) showed that the English version – often the authoritative one – adopted “registered office” as a translation of “siège social.”
</p>
<p>
 Besides, and even more to the point, the
 <em>
  travaux préparatoires
 </em>
 revealed that Belgium fended off an attempt by Algeria to add a “genuine connection” requirement to the BIT’s definition of “investor.” Belgium’s argument even included a reference to the aforementioned holdings of the Barcelona Traction judgment. As a result, the tribunal was satisfied that “siège social” meant “statutory seat” or “registered office.”
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  In any case, OTMTI’s “effective seat” was in Luxembourg
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 The tribunal added, however, that even if the claimant’s nationality had to be assessed on the basis of Luxembourg law, which assigns corporate nationality in terms of the “siège réel” (or place of “central administration,” i.e., effective seat), the claimant would satisfy the jurisdictional requirements
 <em>
  ratione personae
 </em>
 .
</p>
<p>
 Indeed, the tribunal observed, Luxembourg law mainly relied on formal factors in its assessment of a company’s place of “central administration.” Since OTMTI was registered in Luxembourg, had its shareholders and board meetings and kept its corporate and accounting records there, it would be Luxembourgish under Luxembourg laws, and accordingly a “national of a Contracting party” under the ICSID Convention.
</p>
<p>
 The tribunal also cited with approval a statement of the first Tenaris and Talta tribunal according to which the nature of the corporation (as a holding company not charged with much operational work) was relevant for this assessment (a finding shared by the second Tenaris and Talta tribunal, as reported
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/articles/in-new-icsid-award-arbitrators-weigh-in-on-the-effects-of-venezuelas-denunciation-of-icsid-convention-and-then-find-the-state-liable-for-bit-breach/">

 ).
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Objection
  <em>
   ratione materiae
  </em>
  : claimant’s fortuitous investment should not be protected
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 The crux of Algeria’s next objection was that OTMTI had acquired shares in Weather Investments, an Italian entity that (indirectly) owned shares in Djezzy, for the sole purpose of leveraging Weather Investments’ assets with a view to acquiring Wind, an Italian telecoms company. In Algeria’s view, not only was OTMTI’s alleged investment in Djezzy indirect and remote, it was also purely accidental, of a kind that should not be protected under the BIT. Algeria also denied that OTMTI made any reinvestment in Algeria.
</p>
<p>
 The claimant contested this narrative, and in the alternative contended that it was irrelevant for jurisdictional purposes. It added, against Algeria’s objections, that its “contribution” to the investment included, among others, the provision of know-how, services, and assets to Djezzy, but also – and more interestingly – the mere fact of bringing Djezzy within the umbrella of a stronger, international organisation, improving its credit-worthiness and its access to international financial markets in the move.
</p>
<p>
 In answer, the tribunal held that any investment, both under the BIT and the ICSID Convention, had “basic economic attributes” including “contribution or allocation of resources, duration and risk.” Accordingly, even though OTMTI’s indirect stake in Djezzy coincided with one of the example of investment listed in the BIT (i.e., “company shares … including minority of indirect participation”), this did not end the matter.
</p>
<p>
 For the tribunal, however, it was irrelevant that OTMTI acquired this indirect stake in the context of a corporate restructuring whose purpose was to acquire Wind. The BIT explicitly cited indirect ownership in local companies as an example of investment, and OTMTI’s stake had all the features of an investment under both the ICSID Convention and the BIT. In particular, the tribunal accepted that the sums expended, in various manners, by OTMTI to acquire its stake in Weather Investments (and then, indirectly, in Djezzy) qualified as a contribution.
</p>
<p>
 The award also put to rest Algeria’s objection that none of these contributions took place in Algeria. The arbitrators relied on the holdings in
 <em>
  Gold Reserve v Venezuela
 </em>
 , according to which investments do not need to involve funds flowing directly in the host state to qualify under the BIT (see

 ).

 .
</p>
<p>
 ** A footnote records arbitrator Stern’s dissent over this analysis. In Ms Stern’s view, the Barcelona Traction case instructed the tribunal to consult municipal law, thereby requiring analysis of the “siège reel.” For the dissenter, the claimant’s real seat was in Egypt, particularly given Mr Sawiris’ testimony that he was “everything” in the corporate structure. (It is unclear whether Ms Stern disagreed with the tribunal’s full reasoning here, or merely its conclusion that “siège social” means “registered office.” This uncertainty is not helped by the fact that the award’s reasoning is otherwise developed in the name of “the tribunal”.)
