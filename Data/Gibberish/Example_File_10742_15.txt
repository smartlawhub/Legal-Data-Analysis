Dissenter would have seen breach of FET standard   In a 5-page dissenting opinion, Guido Tawil explained that he concurred with his co-arbitrators on Spain’s jurisdictional objections, and likewise with the indirect expropriation claim.  However, he departed from the majority as to Spain’s compliance with the FET standard. In the dissenter’s view, the investor could derive legitimate expectations from the original regulatory regime, which was not too “general” for this purpose. Indeed, for the dissenter, the regime was specific enough in its addressees and ambit to generate legitimate expectations.  The dissent explains however that the main problem with the majority opinion lies in its assessment of the claimant’s expectations. For Mr Tawil, the claimant had a legitimate expectation that the FiT regime would remain in force, and not be abolished in its entirety.  Mr Tawil explained that Spain was perfectly entitled to amend its regulatory framework for public policy reasons; yet, in his view, states should compensate those affected even by licit actions. Mr. Tawil worried that the majority’s reasoning would mean that Spain could similarly abolish the guaranty of a reasonable rate of return without compensating investors. Indeed, Mr. Tawil saw no difference between the expectations of the investor about the availability of the FiT regime, and those with regard to the guaranteed reasonable rate of return.
