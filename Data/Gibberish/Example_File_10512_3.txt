Both parties appear to favour arbitration, but Ghana later asks its High Court to restrain Balkan Energyâ€™s arbitration claim   Relations between the parties soon deteriorated, and both parties alleged that the other failed to perform the PPA.  Ghana stated in August 2009 that the dispute should be referred to arbitration, but it was Balkan Energy that eventually filed a Notice of Arbitration in December of 2009. A few days before the first procedural meeting between the parties and the tribunal, Ghana sought an order from the Ghana High Court of Justice restraining Balkan Energy from taking any step in the arbitration, pending a determination, sought by the state from its domestic courts, that the PPA and the arbitration clause were void. The order was granted.
