Tribunal accepts jurisdiction over state-owned entity under “ Broches test”   Yemen first contended that BUCG did not qualify as an investor under the ICSID Convention, due to the claimant being wholly-owned by the People Republic of China (PRC).  In support of this objection, Yemen relied on the “ Broches test,” named after one of the ICSID Convention’s architects, Aron Broches. Mr. Broches had opined that a state-owned entity could qualify as “a national of another contracting state” under article 25 of the ICSID Convention unless that entity “is acting as an agent for the government or is discharging an essentially governmental function.”  Both parties in the BUCG v. Yemen case agreed as to the relevance of this “test,” but disagreed with respect to its application to the facts. Yemen contended that BUCG was indeed an “agent” for the Chinese government. The state cited as evidence BUCG’s general purpose of advancing the PRC’s development and its national policies.  This did not convince the tribunal, which noted that BUCG had been engaged in a commercial venture when it participated in Yemen’s tender for an international terminal. The tribunal also noted that Yemen itself, at another juncture, described this dispute as an “ordinary garden variety commercial dispute” – that is, a dispute unrelated to the PRC’s national, state-defined policies.  Nor was BUCG “discharging an essentially governmental function” here: even if the Chinese Government were the ultimate decision-maker in BUCG’s performance of the contract, this was too remote from the project to be relevant.
