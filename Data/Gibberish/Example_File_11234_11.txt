Not enough evidence for a judicial expropriation, although concept is embraced by tribunal   Tatneft also claimed that Ukraine’s conduct amounted to a creeping expropriation of its investment. Although the property of Ukrtatnafta was not transferred to Ukraine/Naftogaz, but to Privat Group, this expropriation benefitted Ukraine in that the Ukrainian side took full control of Ukrtatnafta, the claimant argued.  The tribunal acknowledged the difficult question of whether an expropriation can “originate in the judiciary” or in judicial decisions. The case-law was unclear, in the tribunal’s view, as it seemed sometimes to confuse “judicial expropriation” with other standards such as denial of justice or FET. But the tribunal noted that examples of such expropriations existed, such as in the Saipem v. Bangladesh or Sistem v. Kyrgyzstan cases.  In the present case, the arbitrators appeared to be satisfied that the judicial decisions, taken all together, caused the annihilation of the claimant’s investment. But a few “uncertainties” however stood in the way of a finding of expropriation, chief among them the fact that the beneficiary of the alleged expropriation was not necessarily Ukraine/Naftogaz (but instead Korsan and the Privat Group),*** and that it was hard to discern any kind of expropriatory intent on Ukraine’s part (assuming such intent was a necessary element of an expropriation).  The tribunal concluded that “[e]ven if an expropriation were found to have occurred it would be of a rather unusual kind.” Given that the tribunal had already found a breach of FET, it ultimately held that it was unnecessary to rule on expropriation.
