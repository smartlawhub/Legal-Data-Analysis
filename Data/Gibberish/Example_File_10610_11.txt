Tax carve-out deprives tribunal of jurisdiction over part of the dispute   Alternatively, Spain challenged the tribunal’s jurisdiction over part of the claimant’s claim, related to a 2012 tax on electricity production aimed at reducing the tariff deficit. According to Spain, this measure fell within the ECT’s “carve-out” related to tax measures.  The claimant accepted that the tax was a fiscal measure falling prima facie within the carve-out, but contended ( like the Eiser claimant had tried to, unsuccessfully) that it had been enacted in bad faith. The tribunal agreed that the good faith of the measure would be relevant for the applicability of the carve-out, lest states could easily flout investment protection by adopting expropriatory measures under fiscal guise (as a tribunal found happened in Renta4 v Russia ).  Yet, the tribunal also accepted the presumption that a state’s fiscal measures are taken in good faith, and that this presumption “is not easy to demolish.” And on the merits, the claimant’s argument – that the tax was discriminatory in that it did not target every electricity producer equally, and that it was not adapted to its official goal – were unable to overturn the presumption.  (By contrast, the tribunal in RREEF v Spain chose to reserve the carve-out and bad faith question to the merits of the case, see here .)
