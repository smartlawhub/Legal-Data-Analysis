Expropriation claim also successful   The tribunal also found that the actions of the Tucumán authorities amounted to an expropriation under the treaty. The award put to rest Argentina’s contention that contractual rights could not be expropriated, and that expropriation required more than a mere decrease in value of the expropriated assets (the tribunal found that a substantial decrease could constitute an indirect expropriation). The tribunal also explained that the state’s motives underlying the measures were irrelevant for the assessment of their expropriatory nature: the measures’ effect on the investor was the “critical factor”.  Argentina’s actions and omissions, the tribunal held, led to a substantial decrease in the investment’s value, as they “struck at the economic heart of, and crippled, the Claimants’ investment.” The concession was in effect rendered valueless when citizens were convinced by the authorities not to cease paying their bills.
