Ad hoc committee reaffirms narrow scope of annulment proceedings   In answer to Argentina’s contentions, the committee assessed the formal soundness of the tribunal’s reasoning, holding more than once that to second-guess its correctness was beyond the annulment’s scope of review. After endorsing the “point A to point B” test of the ad-hoc committee in MINE v. Guinea , the committee expressed in particular the view that “the tribunal’s job is not to convince Argentina that its analysis and its conclusions are correct. The tribunal is fully free in its reasoning, and it is free to choose the level of details it wishes to enter into in order to explain how it came to its conclusions.”  The committee also insisted that it was beyond its power to review the tribunal’s evaluation of the evidence, or to substitute its own evaluation for that of the tribunal.
