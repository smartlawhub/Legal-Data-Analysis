Domestic law requires specific government approval of procurement contract   The majority confirmed this analysis by finding that the whole investment operation failed to comply with domestic law.  Indeed, the tribunal noted that the law governing procurement contracts in Equatorial Guinea required, for the type of contract at stake in the case, compliance with a “technical and administrative process” that GFHC failed to prove was followed for its investment.  The claimant did not deny this, but argued that the silence from the administration, when it tried to validate the project with it, amounted to an agreement under Guinean law. The majority however noted that this administrative rule applied only in normal administrative proceedings, whereas the law on procurement contracts provided for a special procedure. As a result, silence was no agreement here, which meant that there was no contract between the parties.
