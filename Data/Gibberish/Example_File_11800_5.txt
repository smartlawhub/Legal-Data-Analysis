Merits: investors’ shares made worthless as they are deprived of any rights   On the merits, the investors claimed that their properties had been unlawfully expropriated.  As related by the investors, the crucial fact was that Venezuela ordered Comsigua and Tavsa’s assets to be transferred to the state – an indirect expropriation. Although they acknowledge that they retain possession of their shares, including Talta’s minority stake in Comsigua (after discussions to sell that stake failed), the claimants argued that these shares are now worthless.  While Venezuela conceded that it expropriated Tavsa, it denied that this was the case for Comsigua. The state countered that it had merely acquired the stake of the majority shareholders in Comsigua, leaving Talta with its minority stake untouched.  However, the tribunal focused on the undeniable fact that Venezuela had forcefully seized Comsigua’s assets. Although Tenaris still held title over these shares, the company itself had been rendered an empty shell.  Added to this, Comsigua’s new management had been nominated by executive decree, and there had been no shareholders’ meeting (nor annual reports) since the expropriation, meaning that the investors had been “deprived of any opportunity to participate in the company’s activity or life or to benefit from these”. In other words, the company had been indirectly expropriated.
