After-life of 1994 Kazakh foreign investment law continues to be debated, this time as English court refuses to set aside 2013 award that had declined jurisdiction over investor’s arbitration claim    In a judgment dated March 8, 2017 ( here ), Mr Justice Knowles of the High Court of England and Wales has rejected an effort by a foreign investor, Ruby Roz Agricol LLP, to set aside an arbitral award earlier rendered in its dispute against the Republic of Kazakhstan.  We previously reported on this dispute, which was one of many to arise from political power struggles in Kazakhstan (for examples of other such claims see here ). Ruby Roz’s investment in a Kazakh poultry production and processing facility had allegedly been destroyed by acts attributable to Kazakh officials.  In an award dated August 1, 2013 [ download here ], a tribunal of Alan Redfern (chair), Joseph Neuhaus (claimant’s appointee), and Bruno Boesch (respondent’s appointee) had declined jurisdiction over Ruby Roz’s claims, finding that a unilateral offer to arbitrate in Kazakh domestic law had lapsed before the claimant sought to accept it.  (Kazakhstan had repealed its 1994 Foreign Investment Law in 2003, as part of a seeming trend that has seen some governments renounce legislation that contain unilateral offers to arbitrate).
