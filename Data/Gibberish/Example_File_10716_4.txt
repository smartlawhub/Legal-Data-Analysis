Claimant cannot seek damages for losses that are not its own   The tribunal identified five heads of damages in OTMTI’s claims. The first was the alleged loss OTMTI suffered when it sold its stake in Djezzy through VimpelCom’s acquisition of Weather Investments in 2011 at an impaired price. However, the tribunal found that this impairment was, in the claimant’s own case, allegedly the result of Algeria’s measures that were first mentioned in the 2010 notices of dispute and, crucially, were at stake also in the (settled) OTH arbitration.  Likewise, the damages allegedly sustained by Algeria’s decision to block a dividend payment from Djezzy had also been suffered most directly by OTH, which was Djezzy’s immediate shareholder. This too had been the subject of OTH’s claims in its own arbitration.  By contrast, the claimant’s third head of damages – that it had to compensate minority shareholders under change-of-control put options in the lead-up to the sale of Weather Investments to VimpelCom – was deemed inadmissible for a different reason: “because these alleged losses derive primarily from the presence of put options in an agreement freely entered into by the Claimant,” and because the sale price “must or should have reflected” the alleged loss.  The fourth head of damages referred to costs incurred to keep the structure afloat following Algeria’s measures, such as bridging loans and capital restructuring transactions. Here again, the tribunal was not satisfied that these losses were those of OTMTI proper – rather, they appeared to have been incurred chiefly by Weather Investments and OTH. In any case, such losses should have been reflected, once again, in the price OTMTI received for the sale of Weather Investments to VimpelCom, the tribunal said.  Lastly, the moral damages sought on account of Mr Sawiris’ reputation were deemed to be unrelated to OTMTI, and thus inadmissible as well.
