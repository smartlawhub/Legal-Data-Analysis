Legality requirement is explicit and found in the treaty’s article 12   As a preliminary step in analysing Uzbekistan’s contention that the investment was not made in accordance with Uzbek laws, the tribunal first sought to locate the BIT’s alleged “legality requirement”. The tribunal was satisfied that the treaty’s article 12, entitled “Application of the Agreement”, contained this requirement, as it refers to “investments within the territory of one Contracting Party’s State, made in compliance with its legislation.”  This allowed the tribunal to side-step the question of whether, absent an explicit legality requirement, the BIT would have contained an implicit one. As we have reported, some tribunals have concluded in favour of the existence of such an implicit requirement (see, e.g., Fraport v Philippines (II) , or SAUR v Argentina ).
