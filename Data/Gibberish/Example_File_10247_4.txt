English Court sees no jurisdiction under 1994 Foreign Investment Law, albeit via somewhat different reasoning than earlier tribunal   As for the Ruby Roz claims under the FIL, Mr Justice Knowles followed a somewhat different line of reasoning from the UNCITRAL arbitral tribunal in ultimately finding that Ruby Roz could not rely on the 1994 law’s offer to arbitrate. The Court observed, in particular, that the stabilisation clause applied to “foreign investments”. However, the definition of “foreign investment” under the Foreign Investment Law, had shifted over the years, and was particularly narrow at the crucial dates for purposes of Ruby Roz’s investment, such that Ruby Roz’s investment would not seem to qualify as a FIL-protected “foreign investment”.  This was enough for Mr Justice Knowles to find that the stabilisation clause could not apply to Ruby Roz’s investment, whatever the exact start and stop-dates of the 10-year stabilization period.  As a result, Mr Justice Knowles agreed with the tribunal’s conclusion that it had no jurisdiction, and declined to set aside the award.  Zachary Douglas QC and James Evans were instructed by Gresham Legal to represent Ruby Roz. The Republic of Kazakhstan was assisted by Paul Key QC and Siddharth Dhar, instructed by Curtis, Mallet­Prevost, Colt &amp; Mosle LLP.
