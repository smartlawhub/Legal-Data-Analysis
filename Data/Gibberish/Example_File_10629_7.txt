Fair and Equitable Treatment standard not limited to denial of justice   Analysing the BIT’s central provisions, the tribunal dismissed Argentina’s argument that the BIT’s FET standard was similar to the customary minimum standard of treatment (although the tribunal also later found that Argentina’s actions would have breached this standard). The tribunal rather interpreted FET as an autonomous, objective standard, which encompassed more than mere denial of justice (as argued by Argentina).  In particular, the tribunal found that the standard undoubtedly included an “obligation not to disparage and undercut a concession (a ‘do no harm’ standard) that has properly been granted, albeit by a predecessor government, based on falsities and motivated by a desire to rescind or force a renegotiation.”  The tribunal also smiled on the claimant’s contention that the “full protection and security” standard covered more than mere “physical” security, and could apply to situations of continued harassment of an investor. (This interpretation was later cited and endorsed by the Ares International and MetalGeo v Georgia tribunal; see here .)
