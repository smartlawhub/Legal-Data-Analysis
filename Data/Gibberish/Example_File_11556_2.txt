In first letter, tribunal seeks to terminate the proceedings in good order   The information submitted by Costa Rica in response to the tribunal’s request of March 20 clarified that certain domestic proceedings relating to the land plots had already concluded, contrary to the tribunal’s findings in its Interim Award on jurisdiction. (As we’ve discussed , the tribunal’s finding that these proceedings still remained incomplete underpins the claimants’ current efforts to set aside the award before the DC court.)  Having reviewed this information, the tribunal’s letter to the parties of April 17, 2017 ( click to download ) concluded that the Interim Award (which we’ve reviewed here ) thus contained “an error or omission of a factual nature” that needed to be corrected.  In the tribunal’s view, such rectification was within its power even though the proceedings had been partly terminated, because it had earlier asked the parties to bring any such error to its attention.  In light of both parties’ requests to terminate the arbitration, the tribunal then sought comments from the parties on how to properly do so while also taking note of the error – either by issuing a corrected interim award, or by a special mention in the eventual order terminating the proceedings.  Despite the impending termination of the arbitral proceedings, the US set-aside proceedings seem to be still ongoing.
