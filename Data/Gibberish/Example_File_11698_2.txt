Tribunal upholds jurisdiction, but only over alleged breaches occurring after entry into force   Mexico contested the tribunal’s temporal jurisdiction on two grounds. First, it noted that the treaty entered into force only in late 1996, while some aspects of the claimant’s case took place before this date. Second, Mexico argued that the claimant’s complaint was brought too late – the BIT imposed a three-year time limit on claims following the events giving rise to the claim and most of the relevant events fell outside of this timeframe.  Meanwhile, Tecmed observed that the BIT applied to “investments made prior to its entry into force”. It also insisted that the primary act underlying its complaint – INE’s refusal to renew its permit – was within the three-year timeframe.  On Mexico’s first objection, the tribunal agreed that the BIT did not apply retroactively. Therefore, events preceding its entry into force could not breach the treaty. Regarding Mexico’s second objection, the tribunal confirmed that a claim would be inadmissible if it related to acts occurring more than three years before the claim was filed.  However, this did not mean that such acts and events were not relevant in finding a treaty breach that occurred within the relevant timeframe. The tribunal could thus consider earlier events providing they led to a breach that “took place or reached its consummation point after … entry into force”, and within the three-year limit.  (Later tribunals, such as Paushok v. Mongolia (on which the tribunal president, Mr. Grigera Naón, also sat) have endorsed this reasoning regarding so-called “continuing”, or “composite” acts.)  The tribunal’s temporal jurisdiction thus relied on identifying a relevant treaty breach. (On the merits, as discussed below, the tribunal subsequently found that INE’s Resolution refusing to renew Tecmed’s permit breached the treaty, and that this Resolution occurred within the proper timeframe, thus grounding its jurisdiction.)
