Alleged fraud in relation between claimants and subcontractor   Kazakhstan’s fraud allegations centre on the links between the claimants and Perkwood Investment Limited, a “third party” supplier on a LPG project in Kazakhstan derailed before launch. The arbitrators had awarded the claimants $199 million in compensation for this project.  Documents obtained from the claimants in parallel US disclosure proceedings – and which had not been disclosed in the ECT arbitration in response to the tribunal’s document production orders – as well as the testimony of one of the counsels, revealed that Perkwood was related in some ways to the claimants, who had maintained otherwise during the arbitration proceedings. Suspicious transactions for equipment at seemingly inflated prices, as well as a multi-million management fee for services that had left no trace, corroborated the state’s suspicions.  The fraud, if proven was not innocent, as the tribunal awarded compensation for the LPG project on the basis of an earlier bid by Kazakhstan to acquire the claimants’ assets (see here ). Crucially, Kazakhstan’s valuation of the LPG project was itself partly based, the Court found, on the costs allegedly incurred by the claimants in relation to the project – including the allegedly false costs incurred in the claimants’ dealings with Perkwood. The claimants relied on this bid’s valuation at multiple times during the arbitration, including to ward off Kazakhstan’s efforts to reject a cost-based valuation.  In the Court’s view, this was enough to constitute at least prima facie evidence of fraud, which warranted further and fuller trial.
