  Uzbekistan hopes to replicate former success around “legality requirement”

 , the tribunal rejected nationality-based objections, as well as objections focused on the definition of investor and investment.
</p>
<p>
 The remaining two objections analysed in the March 8, 2017 decision on jurisdiction stem largely from the same essential contention by the respondent: that the claimants’ investment was made in contravention of the BIT’s “legality requirement”.

 Readers will have in mind Uzbekistan’s former dispute against Israel-investor Metal-Tech Ltd., which foundered upon a finding that the investor had breach Uzbek anti-corruption laws (we reported on this case

  Oxus v Uzbekistan
 </a>
 , the state had been less successful over a similar legality objection (but which did not concern anti-corruption laws).
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Legality requirement is explicit and found in the treaty’s article 12
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 As a preliminary step in analysing Uzbekistan’s contention that the investment was not made in accordance with Uzbek laws, the tribunal first sought to locate the BIT’s alleged “legality requirement”. The tribunal was satisfied that the treaty’s article 12, entitled “Application of the Agreement”, contained this requirement, as it refers to “investments within the territory of one Contracting Party’s State, made in compliance with its legislation.”
</p>
<p>
 This allowed the tribunal to side-step the question of whether, absent an explicit legality requirement, the BIT would have contained an implicit one. As we have reported, some tribunals have concluded in favour of the existence of such an implicit requirement (see, e.g.,
 <a href="http://www.iareporter.com/articles/in-depth-the-fraport-v-philippines-2-award/">
  Fraport v Philippines (II)
 </a>
 , or

  SAUR v Argentina
 </a>
 ).
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Legality requirement only relevant for the investment’s establishment
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Studying the contours of the legality requirement, the tribunal found that it had a temporal dimension, such that only breaches of Uzbek law made at the time the investment was made, and in relation to that investment, could unravel the tribunal’s jurisdiction over the case.
</p>
<p>
 As noted by the tribunal, this meant that any “illegal action by Claimants at a later date or an illegal action unrelated to the making of the investment” will need to be determined at the merits stage – but not under the BIT’s legality requirement.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Tribunal is not satisfied with past precedents and offers its own test of legality requirement
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 The parties were also in disagreement regarding what was covered by the legality requirement – for example, whether
 <em>
  any
 </em>
 breach of Uzbek law could suffice to deny the tribunal jurisdiction. The tribunal acknowledged that a “dominant tendency” in past investment jurisprudence had been to restrict the requirement to breaches of “fundamental laws”, and to use “rule-like statements” to frame the requirement’s application.
</p>
<p>
 However, the tribunal expressed its dissatisfaction with this approach. The tribunal considered these “rule-like statements” to be sometimes too detached from the terms of the underlying BITs; besides, although these rule-like statements “provide the comfort of certainty” (rules are clearer and more easily applicable than broad principles), they can be unjustifiably under or over-inclusive.
</p>
<p>
 Rather than adopting “unmoored rule-like statements” from past precedents, the tribunal focused its analysis on the treaty’s article 12. In its view, the “bare bones language” of this article called for the application of a “principle”, as opposed to rules. The tribunal found that the legality requirement, properly interpreted, was neither limited to fundamental rules nor extensive enough as to cover minor acts of non-compliance with Uzbek law.
</p>
<p>
 Rather, then, the “harsh” consequence that results from a breach of this requirement (i.e., that the treaty’s protection would cease to apply entirely to the investment) called for a “proportional” approach, whereby:
</p>
<p>
 “the legality requirement in the BIT denies the protections of the BIT to claims when the investment involved was made in noncompliance with a law of Uzbekistan where together the act of noncompliance and the content of the legal obligation results in a compromise of a correspondingly significant interest of Uzbekistan.”
</p>
<p>
 The tribunal contrasted this principle of proportionality with the “rule-based” approach adopted by others tribunals, but accepted that these rules often pointed to factors relevant for the analysis. It gave the example of the tribunal in Anderson v Costa Rica (see
 <a href="http://www.iareporter.com/articles/class-action-claim-against-costa-rica-cant-clear-jurisdictional-hurdle/">
  here
 </a>
 ), which found, the claimants argued, that an investment made in good faith could still benefit from the treaty’s protection. For the tribunal, good faith was one factor to take into account, but could not constitute an exception to the legality requirement in itself.
</p>
<p>
 As such, the tribunal advocated a three-step analysis, whereby it would first review the importance of the law allegedly breached, second the seriousness of the alleged breach, and third whether the combination of these two elements “results in a compromise of a significant interest of the Host State to such an extent that the harshness of the sanction of placing the investment outside of the protections of the BIT is a proportionate consequence for the violation examined”.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Majority refuses to find alleged security fraud in registering incorrect purchase price with local stock exchange
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 On the facts, Uzbekistan’s illegality objection stemmed from the complex transaction whereby the claimants acquired majority stakes in BC and KC. This transaction included Share-Purchases Agreements (SPA) under English law, for a purchase price of some $34 million, but also additional SPAs registered with the Tashkent Stock Exchange (TSE) disclosing a purchase price of $2.2 million. In the claimants’ case, such structure was necessary given that the Uzbek legal framework was in a state of development at the time; this structure was also advised to them by their broker and the shares’ seller.
</p>
<p>
 For Uzbekistan, however, it violated Uzbek laws on several accounts, as it amounted to concealment, fraud and false disclosure of the security transaction.
</p>
<p>
 By an unnamed majority, the tribunal found that the first alleged violation – the discrepancy between the transaction’s registered and real price – was not “as egregious as Respondent alleges”. Although the claimants’ witness testimony and exculpatory arguments were partly deemed inconsistent and unconvincing by the tribunal, it accepted that the operation took place in a “highly uncertain legal environment” and that the claimants acquired BC and KC in good faith to develop them. Above all, then, it mattered that Uzbekistan could prove no intention to defraud on the claimants’ part.
</p>
<p>
 It is true, the majority held, that the claimants registered an “incorrect” price on the Tashkent Stock Exchange. But this did not necessarily equate to an intention to defraud, or manipulate the market. (In a paragraph, an anonymous dissenter held that this conduct, without which the transaction would likely not have proceeded, was “fraud” under Uzbek law.)
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Failure to register parallel, English law SPAs not serious enough to deny the investment treaty protection
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 A similar analysis was given to Uzbekistan’s argument that the English SPAs should have been registered with the TSE, under three legal instruments. While the majority was doubtful that this was really mandated under Uzbek law (whose lack of clarity the majority again stressed), it concluded that the alleged violation was not serious enough to warrant an adverse jurisdictional holding.
</p>
<p>
 This conclusion was notably based on the sanctions associated with the failure to register. While parties sparred over the sanction provided in one of the legal instrument (Order No. 2003-08), the majority eventually found in favour of the claimants, in that the proper translation of the order provided for the “invalidity” of the transaction (and not it being “null and void”). The milder sanction indicated, the majority held, the lower importance of the rule.
</p>
<p>
 In that respect, the majority stressed that claimants’ expert had a background in law whereas the respondent’s expert had his in economics, and found “significant” that the respondent did not take the opportunity to call and cross-examine the claimants’ expert. (In a paragraph, the anonymous dissenter found that the lesser sanction provided under local law could not diminish the gravity of the claimants’ purposeful avoidance of Uzbek laws, and did not share the majority’s assessment of the respondent’s expert’s credibility.)
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Other alleged breaches with respect to the SPAs dismissed along the same lines
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Several other alleged breaches of laws and regulations raised by Uzbekistan (such as that the registered SPAs were a sham or a fictitious transaction, or that the transaction ran athwart Uzbek’s foundations of the legal order or morality) were dismissed by the majority along the same lines, for either lacking in intent or not being serious enough. (The anonymous dissenter either found that the claimants’ conduct was intentional, or that the breaches were serious enough to fall under the legality requirement.) A few laws and regulations were also found not to apply to the claimants or their conduct.
</p>
<p>
 Uzbekistan also put forward the theory that the claimants’ conduct caused harm to the state, “the BC and KC minority shareholders, the TSE and the brokers, resulting in illicit benefits to Claimants”, in violation of both the Uzbek Civil and Criminal code.
</p>
<p>
 The tribunal accepted that a criminal offence would reach the threshold of the BIT’s legality requirement, and that arbitrators had the power to determine the reality of such offence. However, the tribunal ultimately found that the respondent failed to prove the alleged crimes.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Alleged breaches of Transnational Public Policy are not part of legality analysis
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Finally, the state argued that the claimants’ conduct in concealing part of the transaction was additionally a violation of transnational public policy, that requires “truthful and accurate disclosures” and prohibits alleged manipulations. However, the tribunal concluded that the legality requirement only covered the laws of Uzbekistan, and not this alleged transnational public policy.
</p>
<p>
 As a result, the tribunal dismissed Uzbekistan’s third jurisdictional objection by majority.
</p>
<p>
 As a final note, this finding allowed the majority to side-step the claimants’ defence that Uzbekistan was estopped from making this third jurisdictional objection, as it knew all along of the alleged incorrect price (a strategy that has proved fruitful for the claimant in
 <a href="http://www.iareporter.com/articles/in-depth-the-fraport-v-philippines-2-award/">
  Fraport v Philippines (II)
 </a>
 , in circumstances where the state publicly supported a project that it later deemed illegal). The anonymous dissenter briefly explained that he was unconvinced by the claimants’ estoppel argument.
