BIT award against Kyrgyzstan is annulled in Paris, with Court giving weight to money-laundering allegations that had earlier failed to persuade arbitrators    In a judgment rendered yesterday (February 21, 2017), the Paris Court of appeal has ruled in favour of the Kyrgyz Republic in setting aside a 2014 arbitral award on grounds of international public policy.*   As we reported , an UNCITRAL tribunal of Arbitrator 
   (claimant’s appointee), Neils Schiersing (respondent’s appointee), and Arbitrator 
   , chairing, had ruled in favour of Latvian businessman Valeri Belokon, sole shareholder of Kyrgyzstan-based Manas Bank.  The tribunal awarded around $15 million to Mr Belokon on account of the Kyrgyz Republic’s breaches of the Latvia-Kyrgyzstan BIT, finding that the claimant’s investment had been indirectly expropriated, denied fair and equitable treatment and suffered unreasonable interference.  Readers may recall that a substantial part of the Kyrgyz Republic’s defence in the underlying BIT arbitration was based on allegations of money laundering related to Manas Bank’s operations.  While the arbitrators were sympathetic to the view that money laundering, if proven, might subvert an investor’s BIT claim, the tribunal ultimately held that the respondent’s allegations were not sufficiently proven.  However, in its recent judgment, the Paris Court of Appeal has looked more favourably on the evidence presented by the Kyrgyz Republic to bear out its allegations. While the Paris Court of Appeal was not adjudicating any criminal charges of money-laundering against Mr. Belokon or Manas Bank, the Court concluded that Kyrgyzstan’s allegations met the standard whereby the Court could not recognize or enforce the arbitral award on public policy grounds. Instead, the three judge panel of the French Court deemed that it must be set aside.
