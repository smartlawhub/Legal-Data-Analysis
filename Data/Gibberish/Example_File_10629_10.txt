DCF approach rejected given uncertain future profitability   Looking at the BIT and relevant jurisprudence, the tribunal held that the investment should be compensated for its fair market value. However, the award looked dimly on the discounted cash-flow (DCF) analysis presented by the claimants, finding flaws in its assumptions – and notably its reliance on a future profitability of the investment that was all but uncertain.  Rather, the tribunal favoured an “investment value” approach, designed to replace Vivendi in the position it would have been had it never invested in Tucumán. Although evidence was lacking in this respect, the tribunal explained that “the fact that damages cannot be fixed with certainty is no reason not to award damages when a loss has been incurred. In such cases, approximations are inevitable; the settling of damages is not an exact science.” As a result, around $105 million was awarded to the claimants.  The award shortly dismissed Argentina’s last objection: that full compensation should not be awarded, in light of the economic crisis that hit Argentina in the early 2000s. The tribunal considered that this was irrelevant, as the events underlying the case occurred before this. However, the tribunal held that the claimants should be compensated in dollars, given the peso’s sharp devaluation since the nineties. Compound interest at 6% was added to the compensation awarded.  Costs were split equally between the parties, except as concerned the jurisdictional phase for which Argentina was ordered to cover the claimants’ costs entirely.
