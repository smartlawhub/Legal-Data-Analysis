fifth_para = "Around the shores of the Elegant Isles \nWhere the cat-fish bask and purr \nAnd lick their paws with adhesive smiles \nAnd wriggle their fins of fur, \nThey fly and fly â€˜neath the lilac sky - \nThe frivolous cake, and the knife \nWho winketh his glamorous indigo eye \nIn the wake of his future wife."
sixth_para = "The crumbs blow free down the pointless sea \nTo the beat of a cakey heart \nAnd the sensitive steel of the knife can feel \nThat love is a race apart \nIn the speed of the lingering light are blown \nThe crumbs to the hake above, \nAnd the tropical air vibrates to the drone \nOf a cake in the throes of love."
