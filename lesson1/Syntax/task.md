## Syntax

<b>1.</b> Finally, some basics notions of syntaxes. You write code as you would write anything: sequentially. This means you first define your variables or your functions before using it, or Python won't be able to know what you mean.

An important first concept is the `loop`, which tells Python to do something as long as a condition is not fulfilled. The typical use is to go over (the term is "iterate") a number of elements, for instance in a list.

<b>2.</b> You will note that for your loop to work, the second level of instructions needs to be shifted to the right.

The second important syntax element, and really the basic building block of so much code that runs your daily life, is the `if/else` statement. It simply asks if a condition is met, and then accomplish the resulting code. 
In the example below, we will check that the letter "e" (i.e., a string corresponding to the lower case "e") is present in a list of words.


<b>3.</b> <p>They are several ways to syntax if statements:</p>
<ul><li>With an `in` if need to check that an item is part of a list or a set</li>
    <li>By itself if you are checking a boolean (`if my_bol:` will return `True` or `False` depending on the value of `my_bol`)</li>
    <li>With the double equal sign `==` for identity between two variables, or `!=` for lack of identity</li>
    <li>With a combination of the signs `&gt;`, `&lt;` and `=` when comparing two numbers.</li>
    <li>You can also alter conditions with `and` or `or`.</li></ul>
<p>Finally, a middle point between if and else is `elif`, which gives you another chance to check if a condition 
is met.</p>

<b>4.</b> Note that an issue of adding too many conditions to a line, as above, is that you don't know which one was true or false.

This is all, or nearly. On the basis of the very basic concepts I just introduced to you run most of the rest of the Python scripts you can see out there.
