 In a judgment dated June 1, 2017, the French Supreme Court, (the Cour de cassation) dismissed an appeal by a set of Belgian investors after an award in their favour against Madagascar had been set aside. As there is no further appeal available under French law, the award is now definitely annulled.

  We reported in 2016
 </a>
 when the Paris Court of Appeal chose to set aside the ICC-rules award, on the reason that the arbitrator – Dentons partner Bart Legum – had substituted its own ground for compensation for that demanded by the investors. The Court of Appeal had found that the arbitrator breached the principle of contradiction in failing to hear the parties in relation to the new ground for compensation.

<p>
 The terse judgment of the Cour de cassation merely confirms that the Court of Appeal’s reasoning and interpretation of the award were correct.
</p>
<p>
 To overturn the lower court ruling, the investors would have needed to prove that the Court of Appeal clearly misconstrued the award’s reasoning.
</p>
<p>
 The Cour also followed the Court of Appeal in summarily rejecting an attempt by a third-party funder to intervene in the set aside proceedings.

 DLA Piper’s Brussels office assisted the claimants in the underlying arbitration, while Madagascar was assisted, up to the Court of Cassation by Walid Ben Hamida and Nathalie Martin.
