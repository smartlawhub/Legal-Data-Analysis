Majority refuses to find alleged security fraud in registering incorrect purchase price with local stock exchange   On the facts, Uzbekistan’s illegality objection stemmed from the complex transaction whereby the claimants acquired majority stakes in BC and KC. This transaction included Share-Purchases Agreements (SPA) under English law, for a purchase price of some $34 million, but also additional SPAs registered with the Tashkent Stock Exchange (TSE) disclosing a purchase price of $2.2 million. In the claimants’ case, such structure was necessary given that the Uzbek legal framework was in a state of development at the time; this structure was also advised to them by their broker and the shares’ seller.  For Uzbekistan, however, it violated Uzbek laws on several accounts, as it amounted to concealment, fraud and false disclosure of the security transaction.  By an unnamed majority, the tribunal found that the first alleged violation – the discrepancy between the transaction’s registered and real price – was not “as egregious as Respondent alleges”. Although the claimants’ witness testimony and exculpatory arguments were partly deemed inconsistent and unconvincing by the tribunal, it accepted that the operation took place in a “highly uncertain legal environment” and that the claimants acquired BC and KC in good faith to develop them. Above all, then, it mattered that Uzbekistan could prove no intention to defraud on the claimants’ part.  It is true, the majority held, that the claimants registered an “incorrect” price on the Tashkent Stock Exchange. But this did not necessarily equate to an intention to defraud, or manipulate the market. (In a paragraph, an anonymous dissenter held that this conduct, without which the transaction would likely not have proceeded, was “fraud” under Uzbek law.)
