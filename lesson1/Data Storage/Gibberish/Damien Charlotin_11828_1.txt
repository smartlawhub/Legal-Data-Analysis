Pey Casado files a new UNCITRAL arbitration against Chile; meanwhile, arbitrator challenge is rejected in parallel long-running ICSID claim    While a long-running ICSID case against Chile remains ensnarled in interpretation , rectification and challenge proceedings – with ICSID rejecting today the claimants’ latest effort to disqualify certain arbitrators* – an indefatigable set of claimants are now opening up a new legal front.  Victor Pey Casado, Coral Pey Grebe, and the President Allende Foundation have circulated a request for arbitration, that purports to commence new UNCITRAL-based proceedings against the Republic of Chile.  The April 12, 2017 request [click to download: French or Spanish ] refers to the same Spain-Chile bilateral investment treaty (BIT) at the basis of the ICSID claim Mr Casado and his foundation started twenty years ago.  The new proceedings center on the claimants’ stake in the Consorcio Publicitario y Periódico S.A. (CPP), a Chilean company that owned a newspaper shut down by the Pinochet Government on account of its sympathies for the previous president, Salvador Allende. Mr Pey Casado owned 10% of CPP, which were assigned to his daughter, Ms Pey Grebe, in 2013;** the President Allende Foundation owns the remaining 90%.  Readers will recall that the ICSID dispute, filed in 1998, resulted in a 2008 award that found that the alleged expropriation of the claimants’ investment was beyond the BIT’s temporal scope. Arbitrators did award compensation for Chile’s breaches of the BIT’s fair and equitable treatment standard, but the award was partly annulled in 2012 , when an ad hoc committee found that Chile had been not been able to present arguments with respect to the damages. A second tribunal was thus tasked with hearing the resubmitted claim and last September ruled that the claimants had failed to prove any damages under the BIT. As noted, interpretation, revision and challenge proceedings are still ongoing.
