No ground to pierce the corporate veil under the ECT   Spain’s second objection focused on the ECT’s article 1(7), which defines an investor as “a company or other organization organized in accordance with the law applicable in that Contracting Party.” In Spain’s view, this required the existence in the Netherlands of material and human resources with business purposes, not the mere incorporation of an investment vehicle.  Spain relied on the dissenting opinion of tribunal president Prosper Weil in Tokio Tokelés v Ukraine, and on the majority award in Venoklim v Venezuela (which arbitrator Derains also chaired), to support its request that the tribunal verify the ultimate owner of the investment – here, Spanish and Canadian investors, none of which should be protected under the ECT. In Spain’s view, the Dutch entity was but a “shell entity,” while all decisions were taken by the foreign investors.  The arbitrators, however, disagreed with Spain’s interpretation of article 1(7) ECT, reading in it a mere formal test ratione personae : as long as Isolux was properly incorporated in the Netherlands, an uncontested fact, it should be considered as an investor for the purposes of the ECT.  Nor were there grounds to pierce the corporate veil as Spain proposed here, at least in the absence of fraud. The tribunal noted that Mr. Weil’s opinion in Tokios Tokelés had been a minority one, while Venoklim revolved around a domestic Venezuelan investment statute that mandated lifting the corporate veil to certify that covered investments were genuinely foreign-owned.
