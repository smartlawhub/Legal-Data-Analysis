Rectification proceedings no gateway to amend or alter a decision   The first part of the Vivendi saga had an epilogue, as Argentina sought a rectification decision on a small point that Argentina said the committee had failed to answer, as well as on several “material errors” in the committee’s description of Argentina’s arguments and legal position.  The committee firstly denied having omitted to treat the point flagged by Argentina. It also clarified that rectification proceedings should not serve as gateways to amend or alter a substantial element of the committee’s decision,**** and, on this understanding, rejected most of the rectification requests (while finding two minor clerical errors that could be remedied). Argentina was ordered to bear the costs of these additional proceedings.  In a second article , we cover Vivendi’s dispute against Argentina as resubmitted following the first award’s annulment.
