Constitutional interpretations are arbitrable, even under Ghanaian law (and notwithstanding constitution’s allocation of judicial powers)   Turning to its jurisdiction, the tribunal found that questions of constitutional interpretation were arbitrable, even if Ghanaian law governed the arbitration agreement. Indeed, although article 130 of the Constitution reserved constitutional questions to the Supreme Court, the tribunal read this article as being concerned only with “the organization and allocation of [judicial] powers in the domestic context of Ghana”. Holding otherwise, on the tribunal’s view, would mean that any international dispute against Ghana involving a constitutional question could not be arbitrated. (Editor’s Note: we quote the tribunal’s fuller analysis in an endnote.***)  In its pleadings, Ghana warned against the potential for inconsistent decisions if the tribunal and the Supreme Court, both seized with a constitutional question, ultimately disagreed. On this point, the tribunal answered that the annulment or enforcement stage is the proper moment to discuss inconsistent outcomes, or similar issues of public policy.
