 ANALYSIS: Enforcement of controversial ICSID award against Romania is stayed by UK judge pending EU Court decision, but investors may get security from Romania in interim
</h1>
<p class="f-24">
</p>
<p>
 In a judgment dated January 20, 2017 Mr Justice Blair of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales has ordered a stay of the enforcement of the ICSID award in the case of Micula and others v. Romania.*
</p>
<p>
 The development has been noted in recent days on several legal blogs, including that of Brick Court Chambers – whose barristers were involved in the case. Below, we offer our own in-depth report on the judgment (a copy of which is available
 <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Comm/2017/31.html">

 </a>
 ),
</p>
<p>
 This development in the UK courts is the latest episode in a string of contentious enforcement proceedings opposing not only the Swedish Micula brothers and Romania, but also the European Commission. In the Commission’s view, the ICSID tribunal of Laurent Levy (presiding), Stanimir Alexandrov, and Georges Abi-Saab erred in deciding in favour of the claimants in 2013, as the compensation awarded to them amounts to new state aid, unlawful under European Union law (we reported on the ICSID award

 </a>
 ).
</p>
<p>
 Following a state aid investigation, the Commission’s opinion was made official in a Final Decision dated March 30, 2015, which enjoined Romania from honouring the award (see
 <a href="http://www.iareporter.com/articles/brussels-makes-it-official-romanias-icsid-debt-to-investors-clashes-with-e-u-state-aid-rules/">
  here
 </a>
 ). The investors are currently seeking to annul this Final Decision before the General Court of the European Union (GCEU).
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  High Court declines to set aside the award’s registration, as it is distinct from its enforcement
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 The High Court judgment was prompted by a challenge from Romania (supported by the European Commission) to the registration of the award under the UK’s Arbitration (International Investment Disputes) Act 1966, which encapsulates the UK’s obligation under the ICSID Convention. The investors were granted their initial registration of the award in 2014.
</p>
<p>
 Romania and the Commission later moved to set aside the registration of the award, arguing that the award’s enforcement would conflict with the Commission’s Final Decision and contrary to** the principle of sincere cooperation under article 4(3) of the Treaty on European Union, which “precludes national courts from taking decisions which conflict with a decision of the Commission”.
</p>
<p>
 This did not convince Mr Justice Blair, who refused to set aside the award’s registration order. He noted that registration did not amount to enforcement, and only the latter could potentially conflict with the Commission’s Final Decision. In addition, under the 1966 Act, the claimants were entitled to this registration. As the Commission’s order was directed to Romania only, it did not prevent the investors from seeking this registration.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  The principle of sincere cooperation, and the risk of conflicting decisions, support a stay of enforcement
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 However, the judgment granted Romania and the Commission’s alternative request for
 <em>
  a stay
 </em>
 of the enforcement. Mr Justice Blair acknowledged that the duty of sincere cooperation invoked by Romania and the Commission was applicable, and agreed that enforcement of the award would put Romania in breach of the Final Decision.
</p>
<p>
 Besides, enforcing the award would entail a risk of conflicting decisions with the GCEU’s final determination. For this reasons, as well, a stay was warranted.
</p>
<p>
 The investors raised several arguments to oppose this result. First, they denied that enforcement would put Romania in breach: they argued that any enforcement would not be imputable to Romania, as it would merely be compelled to honour the award.
</p>
<p>
 Second, and in any case, Romania’s obligations under the Final Decision were considered to have been trumped by other considerations. One of these was the award’s
 <em>
  res judicata
 </em>
 effect, which is recognized under EU law. As the award was
 <em>
  res judicata
 </em>
 from the date it was issued (in 2013), a later decision from EU authorities could not undermine its authority.
</p>
<p>
 The investors also contended that the Final Decision was trumped by article 351 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which provides that the European Treaties shall not affect member states’ obligations under agreements predating their accession.*** In this context, they stressed that the ICSID Convention had been signed and ratified by both the UK prior its entry into the EU.
</p>
<p>
 Romania and the Commission contested the relevance of “imputability” in these proceedings: any payment by Romania would put it in breach of the Final Decision. They also denied that the award became
 <em>
  res judicata
 </em>
 in 2013, holding instead that it occurred only with the decision on annulment in 2016 (about which, see our
 <a href="http://www.iareporter.com/articles/in-depth-exploring-the-reasons-why-an-icsid-annulment-committee-has-declined-the-bid-by-romania-and-the-european-commission-to-annul-micula-award/">
  in-depth analysis
 </a>
 ). Alternatively, they argued that neither the principle of
 <em>
  res judicata
 </em>
 nor article 351 were applicable, as they should not allow the High Court to circumvent the Commission’s Final Decision.
</p>
<p>
 In answer, the High Court agreed with the claimants in holding that the award was
 <em>
  res judicata
 </em>
 from the date it was issued, at least as a matter of English law (noting that it might be different for ICSID purposes).
</p>
<p>
 Yet, Mr Justice Blair reasoned that all these issues (the imputability of Romania’s payment, the award’s
 <em>
  res judicata
 </em>
 effects, and article 351) were, in one way or another, already in dispute before the GCEU. This finding strengthened his view that enforcing the award entailed a risk of inconsistent decisions, and, thus, that a stay of the enforcement was warranted pending the outcome of the GCEU proceedings.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  No breach of ICSID Convention in staying enforcement
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 The investors also argued that the UK’s obligations under the ICSID Convention prevailed over its obligations under EU law.
</p>
<p>
 Thus, they contended that the High Court had a duty to enforce the award under the 1966 Act, which provides that ICSID awards are equivalent to judgments of the High Court. Indeed, the 1966 Act, in contrast with the Arbitration Act 1996 applicable to non-ICSID awards, offers no ground for courts to refuse to recognize or enforce the award. This was in keeping with the UK’s obligations under the ICSID Convention.
</p>
<p>
 Mr Justice Blair agreed that, under the ICSID Convention, the UK had to treat ICSID awards as though they were final domestic judgments. However, he also found that this requirement went no further: once registered, an award is “not in a better (or worse) position” than such judgments. In particular, registration does not mean that the award should be automatically enforced: judgments are not.
</p>
<p>
 Therefore, the stay was not a breach of the ICSID Convention because a “purely domestic judgment” would also have been stayed in similar circumstances.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Romania partially paid the award
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <a href="http://www.iareporter.com/articles/as-tribunal-is-finalized-for-second-micula-v-romania-icsid-arbitration-new-developments-come-in-relation-to-earlier-award/">
  As we previously reported
 </a>
 , Romania contended at various times during enforcement proceedings in the US that it had already paid the award in full. This payment was allegedly made by way of a set-off against some taxes owed by the investors. In its effort to set aside the award’s registration, Romania seemingly reiterated this claim before Mr Justice Blair, albeit succinctly (the judgment records that the Commission did “not take a position” on this issue).
</p>
<p>
 The High Court’s judgment offers a clearer picture of the factual record. It reveals that, in addition to a partial early payment, Romania sought to offset the award against taxes owed by one of the claimants’ corporate entities in Romania. However, this set-off was successfully contested by the claimants before the Romanian courts. At the time of judgment, the Romanian Supreme Court was still considering the question. Other payment efforts by Romania were thwarted by the Final Decision.
</p>
<p>
 As a result, the judgment dismissed Romania’s effort to set aside the award’s registration on this ground, as it remained unpaid for the most part.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  No referral to the CJEU on validity of intra-EU BIT
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Readers will recall that this investment dispute has been transformed into a
 <em>
  casus belli
 </em>
 by the European Commission in its general stance against intra-EU Bilateral investment treaties (on this question, see
 <a href="http://www.iareporter.com/articles/ecs-infringement-arguments-come-into-focus-as-the-push-to-dismantle-intra-eu-bits-also-shows-signs-of-broadening/">
  our reporting here
 </a>
 ).
</p>
<p>
 Accordingly, the question of the Romania-Sweden BIT’s validity arose in this dispute as well, with the Commission supporting a reference by the High Court to the Court of Justice of the European Union.
</p>
<p>
 However, the High Court agreed with the claimants that this question was irrelevant to the enforcement issue, and refused to proceed with such a reference. (In its record of the facts, the High Court recalled that, in any event, a similar reference had already been made by the German Federal Court of Justice – a fact we reported
 <a href="http://www.iareporter.com/articles/european-court-of-justice-is-finally-invited-to-weigh-in-on-compatibility-of-intra-eu-bilateral-investment-treaties-and-eu-law/">
  here
 </a>
 ).
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Although Romania and the Commission are successful, investors may be granted security
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 This is not the first success for Romania and the Commission in resisting the enforcement of the award, as the judgment records that a garnishment order obtained on the award has been previously set aside in Belgium (an appeal is under way). Although the investors appear to be more successful in the US (see
 <a href="http://www.iareporter.com/articles/recent-post-award-developments-in-the-micula-v-romania-i-case/">
  here
 </a>
 ), the judgment reveals that these enforcement proceedings, and similar ones in France, Luxembourg, and Sweden, have so far failed to yield any result.
</p>
<p>
 In a potential ray of light for the claimants****, Mr Justice Blair smiled on the claimants’ request for a security from Romania as a term of the stay – although a further hearing will be needed to determine such security’s legality under UK and EU law.
</p>
<p>
 We will report on further developments in this case in due course.
