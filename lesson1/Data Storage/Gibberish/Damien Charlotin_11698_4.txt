Tribunal doubts existence of police powers exception, but also moves beyond “sole effect” test   On the merits, citing the now well-known definition of indirect expropriation in Metalclad v. Mexico ( discussed here ), the claimant argued that Mexico’s conduct amounted to an expropriation in that it entirely prevented operation of the landfill.  In this respect, the tribunal first held that “[t]he government’s intention is less important than the effects of the measures” on an investor. On this criterion alone, the refusal to renew Tecmed’s permit amounted to an expropriation.  Similarly, while the tribunal confirmed that a state’s exercise of police powers “may cause economic damage to those subject to its powers … without entitling them to any compensation whatsoever”, it also found “no principle stating that regulatory administrative actions are per se excluded from the scope of the [BIT], even if they are beneficial to society as a whole”.  However, the tribunal added that it was also “appropriate” to consider other factors apart from a measure’s effects, such as the “characteristics” of the measure, before deciding on its expropriatory character.
