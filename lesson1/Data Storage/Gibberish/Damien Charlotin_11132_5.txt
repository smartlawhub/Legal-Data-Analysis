Committee dismissed Argentina’s illegality defence and its attempt to revise the tribunal’s decision   In the 2012 decision on jurisdiction and liability, the tribunal dismissed Argentina’s arguments regarding some payments OSM made to SAUR’s employees in Argentina, allegedly in a fraudulent manner. The tribunal relied, among other things, on the decision by Argentine court officials to dismiss a criminal case on this very issue, and endorsed SAUR’s interpretation of the factual record.  Argentina later urged the tribunal to revise its ruling on the basis of a further decision by an Argentine court of appeal reinstating the criminal case. In an unpublished 2014 decision on revision, the tribunal declined to grant this request: it found that the new judgment by the court of appeal, which merely reinstated the case and ordered a new inquiry, would not change its findings on the alleged illegality.  At the annulment phase, Argentina argued that the tribunal in its appreciation of the legality of SAUR’s investment manifestly exceeded its power, failed to state reasons, and gravely breached a rule of procedure by failing to consider certain elements of proof, such as this new decision.  The committee disagreed and held that the tribunal properly evaluated the evidence presented by Argentina on this issue. Far from disregarding the decision of the court of appeal, it analyzed it and found it irrelevant. The committee concluded that Argentina was, again, seeking an impermissible de novo evaluation of the evidence.
