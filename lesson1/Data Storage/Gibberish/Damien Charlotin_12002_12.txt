Arbitrators disagreed on costs   The majority decided to split all costs, but since Equatorial Guinea had failed to make one advance payment to the proceedings, it was ordered to pay the claimant half the missing payment.  Although the dissent and the award were first signed by the parties in later July 2015, the dissenter signed an addendum to his opinion in November 2015, explaining that he would have had Equatorial Guinea paying all costs, for failure to comply with the tribunal orders and for providing false information. The majority shortly replied with a “clarification” that stressed that there was no evidence of procedural misconduct on Equatorial Guinea’s part, and repeated that costs were split equally.
