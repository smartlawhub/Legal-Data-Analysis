No contradiction in apportioning costs between the parties   Argentina also attacked the tribunal’s reasoning on the apportionment of costs between the parties, finding it contradictory on at least two counts: because the tribunal held that SAUR prevailed on 100% of its claims, while it received only a quarter ($40 million) of the sums it claimed (more than $143 million), and because it held that Argentina was responsible for the length of the dispute, while finding that the settlement agreement had been entered in good faith by Argentina.  In a few short lines, the committee dismissed these alleged contradictions as artificial. Firstly, SAUR indeed prevailed on 100% of its claims, if not on the quantum, which is a different issue. The tribunal also properly reasoned that it was Argentina’s failure to respect the settlement agreement that prolonged the dispute.
