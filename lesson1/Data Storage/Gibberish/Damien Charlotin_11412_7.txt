Ruling, while appealable, could jolt arbitrators to look more searchingly at money laundering allegations   This does not signal the end of this dispute, as the judgment is appealable to the French Court of cassation on points of law. In the meantime, Mr. Belokon, has not been convicted of any crime. However, Manas Bank and its principals still face criminal proceedings pending in the Kyrgyz Republic, with the Paris judgment revealing that there have been recent witness interrogations undertaken by Russian and Latvian authorities.  In the meantime, the recent ruling, while very fact-dependent and issued in a municipal context, could have reverberations in other ongoing BIT proceedings where money laundering allegations have been aired by states to justify treatment of foreign investors in financial institutions, and indeed may compel some arbitrators to look more searchingly at such allegations.  Valeri Belokon was represented in these proceedings by Paris firm Pellerin, Guerre, De Maria, while the Kyrgyz Republic was assisted by the SCP AFG, as well as local counsels Natasha Tardif and Elise Masse.
