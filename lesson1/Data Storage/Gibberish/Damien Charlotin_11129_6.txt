Sale of some shares to a pair of companies aligned with Tatarstan/Tatneft is very belatedly annulled by courts, under unusual circumstances   This was not the end of Tatneft’s problems: an earlier sale of stakes in Ukrtatnafta to a pair of other companies (Seagroup and AmRuz) that were ultimately allied with the Tatarstan/Tatneft interests came in for belated judicial scrutiny as well. In 2008, the Prosecutor, who had failed in 2002-2003 to invalidate Seagroup and AmRuz’s purchase of shares in Ukrtatnafta, applied to reopen those cases before the Supreme Court.  Ukrainian law allows for such reopening, provided the courts have subsequently applied the same legal provision that was the basis of the earlier case in a different manner. Although such “reopening requests” should be made a maximum of one month following the subsequent case, the Prosecutor sought to rely on a two-years precedent – and Ukraine’s Supreme Court accepted that the Prosecutor had been unaware of this earlier precedent until he sought the reopening.  The cases were then remitted to the lower courts for a ruling, and these courts annulled Seagroup and AmRuz’s share purchase agreement.  These shares, now back in Ukrtatnafta’s hands, were then sold to Korsan (i.e., the company that the claimant alleged to be the stalking horse for the Privat Group raid).
