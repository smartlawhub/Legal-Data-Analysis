Pre-contracts are not contracts, and pre-contractual expenditures do not qualify without a contract   Pressed to point to its contribution to the alleged investment, GFHC stressed that, on the basis of the contracts with the state, it had disbursed funds to study and elaborate on the project, acquired machines in Spain, ordered technical studies from consultancies, and subcontracted with third parties for some minor works before the dispute arose.  In addition, GFHC had created a domestic company named Nueva Edificación for the purposes of the project, together with the joint company, INCOGESA (of which both CFHC and the government had an equal share).  However, the majority noted that according to the Letter of Intention signed by the parties, as well as the agreements regarding the constitution of INCOGESA, the project itself, and particularly its costs, required approbation from the government. The agreements themselves were predicated on conditions (notably obtaining a contract from the government) which, the majority found, were not met by the claimant.  In this view, there was then no contract with the government that would justify the claimant’s expenditures on machines and subcontractors, and qualify them as investments under the BIT.***  Although the majority focused on the “contribution” element of the Salini test, it also later clarified that the “risk” should be the one entailed in the investment itself, not the “mere lost opportunity” of investing in the first place.
