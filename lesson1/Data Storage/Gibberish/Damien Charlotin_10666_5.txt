“Good office” claim fails to find traction   Prevented from airing their claims against the Tucumán authorities, the claimants were only left with vague allegations that the central government failed to do everything it could to protect their rights – notably in view of an alleged “good offices” obligation under the BIT.  The tribunal was unconvinced: it noted that the claimants never asked the central government for a specific action, and that none was obviously available absent a determination by a court that Tucumán (or the claimants) had breached the Concession Agreement. It also rejected as unproven the claimants’ contention that Tucumán’s branches of government had colluded to undermine the concession.  As a result, the tribunal dismissed the claimants’ case. Given that the dispute included issues of first impression and had a mixed outcome (the claimants won on jurisdiction), the tribunal decided to split the arbitration costs between the parties, which were left to bear their own legal costs.
