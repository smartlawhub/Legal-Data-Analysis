Nor does court see Ruby Roz enjoying a valid offer to arbitrate via the Foreign Investment Law   Alternatively, Ruby Roz reiterated its contention that, although the 1994 Kazakh Foreign Investment Law and its offer to arbitrate had been repealed in 2003, a stabilisation clause found in the repealed legislation ensured that its protection would apply to investments for a further period of 10 years.  In Ruby Roz’s case, the 10-years period started to run following an amendment to the contract in 2002 – meaning that there was still a standing offer to arbitrate by Kazakhstan when it sent its Notice of Arbitration in 2010.   As we reported , the tribunal had found that this period started to run from 1999, when Ruby Roz first made its investment, and thus had lapsed before the investor sent its Notice.  ( Editor’s Note:  as we’ve reported , another recently-unearthed arbitral award in the AES and Tau Power v. Kazakhstan case seemed to take a somewhat different reading of the offer of arbitration under the 1994 FIL, with an ICSID tribunal there stressing other key factors – including an investor’s legitimate expectations at the time that an investment was made – before finding that it had jurisdiction under the FIL over those claims.)
