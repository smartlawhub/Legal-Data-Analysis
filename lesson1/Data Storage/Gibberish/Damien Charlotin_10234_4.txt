Tribunal adopts DCF method   In both cases, the tribunal opted for a DCF analysis; indeed, with respect to Comsigua’s valuation (where Venezuela’s opposition to this method had been strongest), the tribunal explained that it “saw no reason to depart from the traditional DCF method, which has become a standard in valuating companies”, especially in a case when the business has reliable data about its past operations. This being said, the tribunal left the door open to comparison with other valuation methods, such as the market multiples approach.  (By contrast, arbitrators in the earlier ICSID case chaired by John Beechey had firmly rejected the DCF and market multiples methods, preferring an “arm’s length transaction” approach).
