 In a judgment handed down on June 6, 2017, Mr Justice Knowles of the Commercial Court in the Queen’s Bench Division of the High Court of Justice has acceded to Kazakhstan’s requests and opened the way for a later trial regarding allegations of fraud by Moldovan investor Anatolie Stati in obtaining an SCC arbitral award in his favour.*

 between one of Moldova’s wealthiest man, Mr Stati, and the Moldavian and Kazakh authorities, the claimant initiated an arbitration against Kazakhstan under the Energy Charter Treaty, alleging that Kazakh authorities mistreated his investment at the urging of Moldova.

 .)
</p>
<p>
 The arbitration was seated in Sweden, and Kazakhstan recently suffered a setback in its efforts to set aside the award before the
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/articles/kazakhstan-fails-in-bid-to-set-aside-half-billion-dollar-energy-charter-treaty-award/">
  Svea Court of Appeal
 </a>
 . The claimants have meanwhile sought to recognise and enforce the award in the UK and the US, where both courts stayed proceedings pending the results of the set aside’s bid.
</p>
<p>
 Given Kazakhstan’s failure to set aside the award before the Swedish courts, the state was precluded from arguing in the UK proceedings that a lack of a valid arbitration agreement, the invalid constitution of the tribunal, or alleged procedural deficiencies should bar recognition of the award in the UK. Rather, the state’s sole remaining argument was that the award would contravene public policy in that it had been obtained by alleged fraud on the claimants’ part.
</p>
<p>
 As we report below, the Court, concerned by the public policy implications entailed in recognising the award “as a judgment of this Court,” preferred to get to the bottom of the fraud allegations and opened the way for a later trial on this question, notwithstanding Kazakhstan’s failure to set aside the award at the seat.

 <strong>
  Alleged fraud in relation between claimants and subcontractor
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Kazakhstan’s fraud allegations centre on the links between the claimants and Perkwood Investment Limited, a “third party” supplier on a LPG project in Kazakhstan derailed before launch. The arbitrators had awarded the claimants $199 million in compensation for this project.
</p>
<p>
 Documents obtained from the claimants in parallel US disclosure proceedings – and which had not been disclosed in the ECT arbitration in response to the tribunal’s document production orders – as well as the testimony of one of the counsels, revealed that Perkwood was related in some ways to the claimants, who had maintained otherwise during the arbitration proceedings. Suspicious transactions for equipment at seemingly inflated prices, as well as a multi-million management fee for services that had left no trace, corroborated the state’s suspicions.
</p>
<p>
 The fraud, if proven was not innocent, as the tribunal awarded compensation for the LPG project on the basis of an earlier bid by Kazakhstan to acquire the claimants’ assets (see
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/articles/in-now-available-award-boeckstiegel-tribunal-valued-kazakh-assets-at-a-half-billion-dollars-but-rejected-key-claim-for-lost-profits-and-opportunities/">
  here
 </a>
 ). Crucially, Kazakhstan’s valuation of the LPG project was itself partly based, the Court found, on the costs allegedly incurred by the claimants in relation to the project – including the allegedly false costs incurred in the claimants’ dealings with Perkwood. The claimants relied on this bid’s valuation at multiple times during the arbitration, including to ward off Kazakhstan’s efforts to reject a cost-based valuation.
</p>
<p>
 In the Court’s view, this was enough to constitute at least
 <em>
  prima facie
 </em>
 evidence of fraud, which warranted further and fuller trial.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  High Court deliberately departs from foreign courts
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Mr Justice Knowles acknowledged the decision of the US District Court for the District of Columbia (tasked with the claimants’ request for recognition of the award in the USA) to refuse to conduct a similar trial on the allegations of fraud. The District Court found that the tribunal had not relied on the fraudulent documents in its decision. Mr Justice Knowles interpreted the reasoning of the District Court narrowly, as referring only to the claimants’ assessment of costs with respect to the LPG project, and not to the indirect influence of these reported costs on Kazakhstan’s appraisal of the project. He also noted that a motion for reconsideration was ongoing in that jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
 Thornier was the case of the Swedish set aside proceedings, as the Svea Court of appeal had dealt with the state’s fraud allegations, but had found that the fraud would have had no direct, nor indirect impact on the award.
</p>
<p>
 However, and “with respect,” the High Court found the Swedish Court’s treatment of the fraud’s indirect impact – through the importance granted to the state’s bid for the LPG plant – insufficient.** While the Svea Court of appeal had found that the bid’s valuation was itself not false evidence, the High Court saw issues in the claimants’ reliance on a valuation it knew (and concealed from the tribunal) to be the product of a fraud.
</p>
<p>
 For this reason, the High Court held that there was no estoppel in this case, as the question of the fraud’s indirect impact on the award remained pending. In any case, these recognition and enforcement proceedings were concerned with the award’s compliance with English public policy – not Swedish public policy.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  High Court holds defrauded party to lower standard of due diligence
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 The claimants argued that Kazakhstan should have known, at the time of the arbitration, of its link with Perkwood. Indeed, Kazakhstan had already aired several allegations of fraud regarding Perkwood during the arbitral proceedings, such as that the claimants had siphoned money from the state through its transactions with Perkwood, or that they had tried to mislead potential investors with respect to the economic viability of the LPG project. Such allegations, in the claimants’ view, should have led Kazakhstan to further question the links between Perkwood and the claimants and, ultimately, the soundness of Kazakhstan’s bid for acquiring the project.
</p>
<p>
 However, the High Court accepted that defrauded parties should not be held to an overly high standard of diligence, holding that “the Claimants, if dishonest, are not to escape if the right stone was not turned over by the State.” It mattered in this respect that the contracts with Perkwood that revealed the alleged fraud had not been disclosed in the arbitration, despite falling within the scope of the document production requests, and that the claimants resisted until the Swedish set aside proceedings to concede their links with Perkwood. As a result, the state will be allowed to rely on evidence it obtained since the end of the arbitration proceedings in the later trial.

 * The arbitration was also filed on behalf of Mr Stati’s Moldovan/Romanian son Gabriel Stati, Ascom Group S.A. (incorporated in Moldova), and Terra Raf Trans Traiding Ltd (incorporated in Gibraltar). Note: due to an editing error, the first paragraph of this article had briefly mentioned ICSID, although it should be otherwise clear that the case is an SCC case. We’ve now corrected this.
</p>
<p>
 ** Mr Justice Knowles was also troubled by a statement of the Swedish Court to the effect that “in a procedure amenable to out-of-court settlement such as arbitration, it cannot be demanded that a party provide the opposing party with information which speaks against the party’s own case.”
