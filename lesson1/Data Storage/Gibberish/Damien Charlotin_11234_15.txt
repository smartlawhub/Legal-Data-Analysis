Tribunal takes its own path and looks at initial share purchase price – although there was disagreement among the tribunal on that sum   Ultimately offering its own valuation approach, the tribunal stressed the very limited amount of reliable data. In these circumstances, the best approach was to rely on the “best available evidence,” which was simply what the claimant had effectively paid for its shares in 2000 (when it acquired a 8% stake from a temporary shareholder) and 2007 (when it acquired 49% of AmRuz and 100% of Seagroup).  “As a result, the Claimant will essentially be reimbursed for what it has paid,” the tribunal concluded. Tatneft’s claim for any increase in the shares’ value since acquisition also stumbled on the lack of reliable data. This resulted in approximately $112 million in damages, exclusive of interest. (The award records a dissent with respect to the compensation; the unnamed dissenter would have awarded only half this figure, on the basis that “the alternative methodological valuations could not result in a figure greater than US$ 52.3 million”.)  Three-months compounded interest at USD LIBOR +3% was granted, and the costs of the arbitration (in excess of $2 million) were split in half (without much reasoning). Each party was left to bear its own legal costs.
