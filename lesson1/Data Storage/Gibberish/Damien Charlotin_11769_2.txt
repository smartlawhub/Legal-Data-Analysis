Treaty-based disputes still ongoing, as earlier abuse of process has been cured   As readers will recall, the pipeline controversy has also prompted two investment-treaty arbitrations against Egypt, filed on the same day in May 2012. One of these culminated this year, when an ICSID tribunal held Egypt liable under the Egypt-United States BIT. As we reported , the tribunal found that Egypt should compensate Ampal-American Israel Corporation and several other minority shareholders in EMG, although the tribunal’s assessment of damages is yet to come.  A second treaty claim was brought by Ampal-American’s former CEO and shareholder in EMG, Yosef Maiman, and is still pending before a UNCITRAL tribunal established under the Egypt-Poland BIT. The tribunal made a jurisdictional determination in that case at the end of 2015, and another affirmation of jurisdiction in May of 2016.**  The two arbitrations initially partially overlapped with respect to the shares in EMG at the basis of the claim (Ampal-American’s claim was partly based on shares it indirectly held through one of the claimant in the UNCITRAL arbitration). This prompted the ICSID tribunal to invite the claimants to elect in which forum they preferred the overlapping claims to be heard, in order to “cure” what the tribunal considered to be an abuse of process.  As recounted by the liability award in the ICSID case, Ampal-American and Mr Maiman chose to split the claims between the two arbitrations and remove any overlap. This move was sanctioned by an August 15, 2016 decision of the ICSID tribunal (still unpublished), which found that the abuse of process had been cured. As a result of this election, Ampal-American is now only seeking compensation for its 8.21% indirect shareholding in EMG (as opposed to 12.5% previously) in the ICSID arbitration.
