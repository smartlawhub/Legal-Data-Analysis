 In a jurisprudential departure, Shin-Fortier-Douglas decline jurisdiction and reject theory that investor could accept BIT consent to arbitration after Venezuela notified its denunciation of ICSID Convention
</h1>
<p class="f-24">
</p>
<p>
 In an apparent first, Venezuela has defeated on jurisdictional grounds an arbitration filed
 <em>
  after
 </em>
 the country had notified ICSID in January of 2012 of its denunciation of the ICSID Convention, but mere days
 <em>
  before
 </em>
 that denunciation took full effect.
</p>
<p>
 The development comes in the case of Fábrica de Vidrios Los Andes, C.A. and Owens-Illinois de Venezuela vs. Venezuela*
</p>
<p>
 In an award dated November 13, 2017, the unanimous tribunal of
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/arbitrator/Shin">
  Hi-Taek Shin
 </a>
 (Chair),
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/arbitrator/Fortier">
  Yves Fortier
 </a>
 (claimants’ appointee) and
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/arbitrator/Douglas">
  Zachary Douglas
 </a>
 (Venezuela’s appointee) dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention.
</p>
<p>
 Volterra Fietta in London and Escritorio Muci-Abraham &amp; Asociados in Caracas represented the claimants in this case; Venezuela relied on its in-house counsel assisted by Guglielmino &amp; Asociados from Buenos Aires and Diego Brian Gosis in Florida.
</p>
<p>
 The tribunal’s reasoning is notable in that it breaks with other recent cases that had to deal with Venezuela’s denunciation of the ICSID Convention. [UPDATE: in addition to what appears below, we have now published a fuller analysis of the award,

 <strong>
  “Consent” in article 72 means perfected – not unilateral – consent
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Readers will recall that under article 71 and 72 of the ICSID Convention, the Convention remains in force for six months following denunciation, and that a denunciation notice “shall not affect the rights or obligations under this Convention of that State […] arising out of consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre given […] before such notice was received by the depositary.”
</p>
<p>
 The challenge in this case was to determine whether there was consent prior to the denunciation becoming effective in July of 2012.
</p>
<p>
 The tribunal interpreted Articles 71 and 72 as referring only to “consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre” already perfected at the time of the denunciation in January of 2012, a category that did
 <em>
  not
 </em>
 include the unilateral consent to ICSID arbitration found in the underlying BIT. As such, that unilateral consent in the BIT was not available to be accepted by the claimants following Venezuela’s January 2012 denunciation notice.
</p>
<p>
 The claimants’ case can be distinguished, on the facts, from a pair of recently-decided cases, the

  Valores de Mundiales v. Venezuela
 </a>
 proceedings, in that the tribunals in these cases dated the investors’ consent to ICSID arbitration prior to Venezuela’s January 2012 notice of termination (e.g., by filing notices of dispute that made clear that the investors accepted the consent located in relevant BITs.)
</p>
<p>
 However, arbitrators in the new Fabrica award also distinguished their holdings from those in a pair of cases –

  Blue Bank v. Venezuela
 </a>
 – where tribunals had accepted jurisdiction over disputes where the investors had not expressed their consent until after Venezuela issued its denunciation notice (but before the six month taking effect of that notice.) The tribunal in the Fabrica case observed that arbitrators in the Venoklim and Blue Bank cases appeared to have upheld jurisdiction without much discussion over whether “consent” in the Convention’s article 72 was to be interpreted as “unilateral” or “perfected.”
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Although it prevailed, Venezuela is not awarded its legal costs
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Despite Venezuela’s success in dismissing the claims, the tribunal refused to order the claimants to bear Venezuela’s legal costs, referring to the several (unsuccessful) challenges brought by the state against Mr Fortier (we reported on the fourth of these challenges
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/articles/venezuela-hires-private-investigator-to-examine-ties-of-yves-fortiers-secretary-to-his-former-law-firm-but-again-fails-to-make-out-its-case-for-disqualification/">

 ), as well as to Venezuela’s refusal to pay its advance on costs during the proceedings. The tribunal however ordered the claimants to shoulder the costs of the arbitration.
