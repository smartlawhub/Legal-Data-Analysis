Argentina raises ‘federal’ objections to jurisdiction   Argentina raised several objections to jurisdiction in the case. While it accepted that the claimants had an investment in Argentina under the BIT, the latter provided for jurisdiction only in case of disputes between the investors and Argentina. As the Concession Agreement involved only the Tucumán province and not the central government, Argentina denied the existence of any such dispute. The state insisted that the actions of the province could not be attributed to the central government, given Argentina’s federal system.  This did not convince the tribunal, which recalled that under international law, acts of federal subdivisions of a state are attributable to the national government. In any case, the tribunal accepted the claimants’ argument that some claims addressed Argentina’s own actions and omissions with respect to the behaviour of the Tucumán authorities.  Argentina further pointed out that article 25(3) of the ICSID Convention – which lays out the jurisdictional requirements of ICSID arbitrations – provides that “[c]onsent by a constituent subdivision … of a Contracting Party shall require the approval of that State unless that State notifies the Centre that no such approval is required[.]” Since no such approval had been given for Tucumán, the argument went, the tribunal had no jurisdiction.  Having found that the dispute was properly between the investors and Argentina (and not the province), the tribunal had no trouble dismissing this objection as moot. It interpreted article 25(3) as an option to extend the jurisdictional scope of the ICSID Convention for efficiency reasons, not as an additional jurisdictional requirement.*
