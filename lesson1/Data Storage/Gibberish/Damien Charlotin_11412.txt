 BIT award against Kyrgyzstan is annulled in Paris, with Court giving weight to money-laundering allegations that had earlier failed to persuade arbitrators

<p>
 In a judgment rendered yesterday (February 21, 2017), the Paris Court of appeal has ruled in favour of the Kyrgyz Republic in setting aside a 2014 arbitral award on grounds of international public policy.*

 , chairing, had ruled in favour of Latvian businessman Valeri Belokon, sole shareholder of Kyrgyzstan-based Manas Bank.
</p>
<p>
 The tribunal awarded around $15 million to Mr Belokon on account of the Kyrgyz Republic’s breaches of the Latvia-Kyrgyzstan BIT, finding that the claimant’s investment had been indirectly expropriated, denied fair and equitable treatment and suffered unreasonable interference.
</p>
<p>
 Readers may recall that a substantial part of the Kyrgyz Republic’s defence in the underlying BIT arbitration was based on allegations of money laundering related to Manas Bank’s operations.
</p>
<p>
 While the arbitrators were sympathetic to the view that money laundering, if proven, might subvert an investor’s BIT claim, the tribunal ultimately held that the respondent’s allegations were not sufficiently proven.
</p>
<p>
 However, in its recent judgment, the Paris Court of Appeal has looked more favourably on the evidence presented by the Kyrgyz Republic to bear out its allegations. While the Paris Court of Appeal was not adjudicating any criminal charges of money-laundering against Mr. Belokon or Manas Bank, the Court concluded that Kyrgyzstan’s allegations met the standard whereby the Court could not recognize or enforce the arbitral award on public policy grounds. Instead, the three judge panel of the French Court deemed that it must be set aside.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Court of appeal judgment does not clarify the alternative ground for set-aside: alleged partiality of the tribunal for issues conflict
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 The Kyrgyz Republic sought to set aside the award on two grounds: wrongful constitution of the arbitral tribunal and breach of international public policy, but the Court of appeal only considered the latter ground. Since the Paris Court focused its attention on the separate public policy ground, the details of the former argument are not spelled out in the recent judgment. Possibly, it may have been linked to the two challenges brought unsuccessfully against Kaj Hober and Jan Paulsson in the weeks preceding the BIT arbitration’s hearings.
</p>
<p>
 At that earlier juncture, Kyrgyzstan had raised several concerns about the arbitrators, including so-called issue conflicts arising from the allegedly pre-existing views of the two arbitrators in relation to the concept of denial of justice. (The Secretary General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, Hugo Siblesz

 <strong>
  Before Paris Court, Kyrgyz Republic restates its allegations on money laundering
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 A substantial part of the Kyrgyz Republic’s defence in the underlying BIT arbitration was based on allegations of money laundering related to Manas Bank’s operations. Indeed, ongoing criminal proceedings targeted at Manas Bank’s activity and management in Kyrgyzstan punctuated the arbitral proceedings, with the Kyrgyz Republic seeking twice to stay the arbitral proceedings – unsuccessfully.
</p>
<p>
 As noted above, the tribunal were sympathetic to the view that money laundering, if proven, might derail an investor’s claim and justify some extraordinary state behaviour. However, the arbitrators ultimately held that the respondent did not discharge its burden of proof. In that respect, the tribunal stressed that the Kyrgyz Republic’s own officials had been rebuked at two stages by the Kyrgyz Courts for failing (at those junctures) to marshal enough evidence to bear out the charges.
</p>
<p>
 Acknowledging this setback, the Kyrgyz Republic explained it by the difficulty of gathering evidence in this kind of criminal case, and the protection that Mr Belokon allegedly enjoyed due to his relationship with the former Kyrgyz President’s (powerful) son. By the time that the Kyrgyz Republic was making its set-aside case before the Paris Court of Appeal, the respondent professed to have gathered more evidence to bear out its allegations of money-laundering.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Investor succeeds in excluding certain evidence in Paris proceedings
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 As a preliminary aspect of the Paris proceedings, Mr Belokon asked the court to disregard some pieces of evidence introduced by the Kyrgyz Republic. Mr. Belokon contended that this evidence was illegally obtained by the Kyrgyz Republic during the criminal investigation, and as a result of the expropriation of Manas Bank.
</p>
<p>
 Although the Court held that, where international public policy is concerned, it is justifiable to take into account evidence that was not available to the arbitral tribunal, nevertheless due process must be respected.
</p>
<p>
 After noting that the Kyrgyz Republic did not deny that Mr Belokon had had no access to the prosecution’s evidence during the criminal inquiry, the Court accepted that this lack of due process warranted the exclusion of the challenged evidence.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Some of the tribunal’s factual findings are rebuked, including in relation to relationship of Belokon and former President’s son
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Turning to the allegations of money laundering, the Court of appeal acknowledged that, at the time of the arbitral award, and while the Kyrgyz Republic’s defence lay “entirely” in these allegations, no criminal court had found them to be proven. (Indeed, this is still the case to this day, with no clear view of where exactly the still-ongoing local criminal proceedings stand at the present.)
</p>
<p>
 Nonetheless, the Court of appeal stressed that prohibition of money laundering is part of French international public policy; and while the court, in set aside proceedings, cannot give a determination on the criminal charges brought against any particular defendant, it has to ensure in reviewing the award that recognition or enforcement of the award would not run counter to international public policy. Thus, in this respect, it was not relevant that there has been no final determination in Kyrgyzstan of the money laundering claims.
</p>
<p>
 On the facts, the Court stressed the power that Maxim Bakiev, son of Kurmanbek Bakiev, President of the Republic between 2005 and 2010, had over the country’s economy. At the same time, Maxim Bakiev was known to Mr Belokon (they notably co-founded a Latvian company in 2006). When the Kyrgyz Republic had put this relationship before the arbitrators, they found that they could not “make a positive determination that there was anything improper in the Claimant’s acquaintance with Mr. Bakiev’s son, Maxim Bakiev, which was not shown to have been more than superficial”.
</p>
<p>
 In a rebuke, the Court of appeal held that this relationship “appear[ed] as being not superficial, and could be considered inappropriate, insofar” as Mr Bakiev benefitted from Manas Bank in some ways that could be “categorized as misuse of corporate assets” (Of particular note,, Maxim Bakiev lived in Manas Bank’s building without paying rent).
</p>
<p>
 A similar rebuke was directed at the tribunal’s failure to make a positive determination (citing insufficient evidence) about the propriety of the auction process whereby Mr. Belokon had acquired the local bank that was later renamed as Manas Bank). In the Court’s assessment, the evidence put forward by Kyrgyzstan “established sufficiently that the auction process unfolded in irregular circumstances”. Indeed, the other bidder in that auction was Mr Belokon’s lawyer and was related to him in various ways – including a contract signed between Mr Belokon and one of the companies owned by his lawyer, that had been concluded prior to the auction’s results, and yet pertained to setting up of local premises for the targeted bank.
</p>
<p>
 In seeking to rebut the money laundering allegations, Mr Belokon had relied on the results of an audit of Manas Bank in 2010 that found nothing illegal. The Court, however, accepted that the evidence gave support to the Kyrgyz Republic’s view that the auditor’s impartiality was doubtful, as she owned several safes at the bank’s premises, containing several million dollars in cash. While this evidence had been put before the tribunal, the tribunal had not commented on it. However, for the Court, this evidence cast strong doubt on the reliability of these audits.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Court ultimately takes different view of key evidence and finds the money laundering accusations were sufficiently supported to justify set-aside
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 The Kyrgyz Republic’s case was based on the links between Manas Bank and the Baltic International Bank, both owned by Mr Belokon. The Court noted that the latter has recently been fined by the Latvian financial regulator as it failed to observe its anti-money laundering obligations.
</p>
<p>
 On this basis, the Kyrgyz Republic alleged that the investment in Manas Bank was a way for Mr Belokon and the BIB to take advantage of the Republic’s weaker institutions to pursue their unlawful activities. In the Court’s view, these allegations “appeared” to be true. It found confirmation for the Kyrgyz Republic’s opinion on the basis of “serious, precise and corroborative” evidence (the French legal standard for these allegations in such proceedings).
</p>
<p>
 Notably, the Court relied on two reports by East Star Capital that had been criticized on various grounds by the BIT tribunal. Notwithstanding these criticisms, the Paris judges stressed that the volume of transactions in nearly three years at Manas Bank, an entity close to bankruptcy before its acquisition by Mr Belokon, was greater than the Kyrgyz Republic’s GDP in 2008, and that most of these transactions involved offshore counterparts.
</p>
<p>
 On the Court’s view, this “lightning success within such a short time, in such a poor country, cannot be explained by usual banking practices”. Rather, and for the purpose of setting aside the award, the Court found sufficient evidence that Mr Belokon acquired Manas Bank on the basis of his links with the Kyrgyz authorities of the time, to develop “money laundering operations that could not have flourished in the less favourable Latvian environment”. In such circumstances, declining to set aside the award would mean that Mr Belokon would receive the proceeds of potentially unlawful operations – a result prohibited by French international public policy.
</p>
<p>
 As a result, the award was set aside, Mr Belokon’s counterclaim for vexing proceedings denied, and €300,000 in costs awarded to the Kyrgyz Republic.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Ruling, while appealable, could jolt arbitrators to look more searchingly at money laundering allegations
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 This does not signal the end of this dispute, as the judgment is appealable to the French Court of cassation on points of law. In the meantime, Mr. Belokon, has not been convicted of any crime. However, Manas Bank and its principals still face criminal proceedings pending in the Kyrgyz Republic, with the Paris judgment revealing that there have been recent witness interrogations undertaken by Russian and Latvian authorities.
</p>
<p>
 In the meantime, the recent ruling, while very fact-dependent and issued in a municipal context, could have reverberations in other ongoing BIT proceedings where money laundering allegations have been aired by states to justify treatment of foreign investors in financial institutions, and indeed may compel some arbitrators to look more searchingly at such allegations.

 Valeri Belokon was represented in these proceedings by Paris firm Pellerin, Guerre, De Maria, while the Kyrgyz Republic was assisted by the SCP AFG, as well as local counsels Natasha Tardif and Elise Masse.
