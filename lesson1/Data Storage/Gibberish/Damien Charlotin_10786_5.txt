Second tribunal considers the relevance of previous award for new proceedings*   Undaunted, Waste Management initiated new proceedings a few weeks later, on June 19, 2000. This led to the constitution of a tribunal with Benjamin R. Civiletti (claimant’s appointee), Eduardo Magallón Gómez (respondent’s appointee), and Arbitrator 
   presiding.**  Mexico challenged the investor’s right to file this new submission: in its view, NAFTA’s Chapter 11 offered investors only one opportunity to seek international redress.  In a preliminary decision dated June 26, 2002 [ click to download ], the tribunal rejected Mexico’s contention, finding that it was not borne out by the treaty’s language, nor by general international law.  The tribunal also sided with the investor on the issue of res judicata : contrary to Mexico’s contentions, the first award had res judicata implications only on issues it considered, i.e., only on the first waiver’s validity. As the award said nothing of the merits of the case, this new tribunal was not barred from ruling on them.  The tribunal’s engagement with the res judicata effect of previous proceedings was one of the first in the investment treaty arbitration realm. Worthy of note, the test applied by the tribunal (identity of parties and of the issue decided) was the same adopted (after more debate) in some later NAFTA arbitrations, such as Apotex v. USA .
