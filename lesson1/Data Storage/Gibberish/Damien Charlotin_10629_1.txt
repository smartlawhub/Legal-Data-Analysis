Looking Back: In resubmitted Vivendi proceedings following annulment, tribunal confirms jurisdiction and finds Argentina in breach of FET     (Editor’s Note: This is a report in our new series examining investment treaty awards that were rendered prior to the launch of IAReporter in 2008. Other articles in this series can be found here .)   The annulment of the first Vivendi v. Argentina award, reviewed in our companion piece , meant that the road was cleared for the claimants to resubmit the case to ICSID – which they did, by a Request for Arbitration dated August 29, 2003.  This led to the constitution of an arbitral tribunal of Arbitrator 
   (chair), Arbitrator 
   (claimants’ appointee) and Carlos Bernal Verea (Argentina’s appointee). On November 14, 2005, the tribunal issued a Decision on Jurisdiction, reviewed below and available here .  Notably, the tribunal confirmed that jurisdiction should be appreciated as at the start of the proceedings, and that the first tribunal’s jurisdictional findings had res judicata effects over the second tribunal.  Following its decision on jurisdiction, the tribunal ruled on the merits of Vivendi’s claims in an August 20, 2007 award (available here ), also reviewed below. The “Vivendi II” award is notable for reviewing the Fair and Equitable Treatment (FET) standard under Argentina’s BITs, and for opting for a different valuation method where the DCF analysis is inappropriate.  This award was also subject to (unsuccessful) annulment proceedings in 2010, as we reported . ( We also reported in 2013 on the efforts by the claimant to collect payment under the award.)  The claimants continued to be represented by Arbitrator 
   , along with a team from Sidley Austin Brown &amp; Wood, LLP and a pair of local counsel, Luis A. Erize and Ignacio Colombres Garmendia. Argentina relied on its in-house counsel, assisted by a team from (then) Mayer, Brown, Rowe &amp; Maw.
