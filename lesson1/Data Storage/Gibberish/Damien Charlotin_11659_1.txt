Canadian miner, backed by its funder, defeats Venezuela’s attempt to set-aside $1.4 billion BIT award    The dispute pitting Canadian-based Crystallex International Corporation against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela reached a further stage last week, when the US district court for the District of Columbia confirmed a $1.4 billion ICSID Additional Facility award in the investor’s favour.  Last year, a tribunal of Arbitrator 
   (chair), Arbitrator 
   (claimant’s appointee) and Laurence Arbitrator 
   (respondent’s appointee) awarded damages to the Canadian miner under the Canada-Venezuela Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) ([ click to download ]; we dissected the award’s findings here , here and here ). The dispute stemmed from Venezuela’s mistreatment and expropriation of the claimant’s investment in the Las Cristinas deposit, one of the largest undeveloped gold deposits in the world.  The March 25 th , 2017 opinion by the district court [ click to download ] is a blow to Venezuela’s hopes to annul the award at its seat, and will facilitate further recognition and enforcement of the award in the US and abroad.* (Crystallex had already obtained recognition of the award in Canadian courts by way of a default judgment in July 2016.)  The development also represents a victory for the third-party funder behind the Canadian miner. As we noted at the time , the distressed Crystallex (whose Venezuelan mines were its only asset) fought its creditors in Canadian courts to accept a funding agreement by New York-based Tenor Capital Management. Under the deal that gave Crystallex a lifeline during the arbitration, Crystallex agreed to reserve 35% of any compensation awarded for Tenor Capital Management.
