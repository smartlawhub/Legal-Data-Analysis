Looking Back: in Waste Management v. Mexico, two tribunals discuss waivers, res judicata, the meaning of Fair and Equitable Treatment, and much else     (Editor’s Note: This is a report in our new series examining investment treaty awards that were rendered prior to the launch of IAReporter in 2008. Other articles in this series can be found here .)   Waste Management v. Mexico (II) is often cited for its analysis of the Fair and Equitable Treatment (FET) standard; but this dispute – which spawned two consecutive arbitrations – was also one of the first to involve issues such as waiver under NAFTA, res judicata , or the arbitrability of contractual disputes  that would become staples of later investment proceedings.  Acaverde, the Mexican subsidiary of US-based Waste Management, Inc., was awarded a concession from the city of Acapulco to perform waste removal services in the city’s main tourist areas. The contractual framework included a line of credit from a Mexican government bank, Banobras, which served as a guarantor.  The investor filed in 1998 a claim under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), under the ICSID’s Additional Facility Rules. It claimed that, on top of various other contractual breaches, Acapulco eventually refused to pay its invoices, while Banobras soon ceased guaranteeing these debts. This conduct allegedly breached NAFTA’s articles 1105 and 1110.  However, as we discuss below, a first arbitration brought by the claimant was dismissed due to the investor’s failure to comply with the NAFTA’s waiver requirement. In a second proceeding, before a new tribunal, all of the investor’s claims were rejected.
