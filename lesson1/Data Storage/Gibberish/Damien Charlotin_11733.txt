<p>
 The Mondev International Ltd. v. USA case was the first investor-state dispute against the United States to reach a final award under the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</p>
<p>
 The case arose out of a failed development project in Boston, where Canada-based Mondev, through its American subsidiary LPA, entered into a 1978 tripartite agreement with the city and its development arm (BRA). LPA was granted an option to purchase a certain parcel of land (and the air rights to build upon it), according to a price formula set in the agreement.
</p>
<p>
 Various issues prevented the investor from exercising this option before it lapsed, in 1989. In Mondev’s narrative, the city frustrated this exercise purposefully, as the price pursuant to the 1978 formulae was much lower than the 1989 market price.
</p>
<p>
 A case was soon filed by LPA in US courts, and resulted in a jury finding against the city and BRA. No verdict was entered against BRA, however, due to its immunity for intentional torts, and the city subsequently won on appeal. Mondev’s appeals to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC), finally decided in 1998, proved fruitless; the US Supreme Court later denied it
 <em>

 </em>
 .
</p>
<p>
 In 1999, the investor put the United States on notice of a NAFTA Arbitration, and subsequently filed a claim with ICSID under its Additional Facility Rules. A tribunal composed of Sir Ninian Stephen (chair agreed by the parties), professor

 (claimant’s appointee) and

 (respondent’s appointee) was constituted and later rendered its award on October 11, 2002 [

 </a>
 ].
</p>
<p>
 Mondev was represented by White &amp; Case LLP and Hale and Dorr LLP, and Sir Arthur Watts of 20 Essex Street. Until December of 2000, Charles N. Brower, who would later become one of the most commonly-appointed investment treaty arbitrators, was also a member of the White &amp; Case team. The United States was represented by in-house counsel.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  No confidentiality obligation in NAFTA arbitral proceedings
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 The early proceedings were characterized by multiple skirmishes between the parties over the secrecy of the proceedings. Mondev objected to the disclosure of the case’s documents by the respondent, and notably also to the disclosure of some documents sought by third parties under the USA’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The respondent countered that there was no confidentiality requirement under NAFTA Chapter 11, and that it had to comply with the FOIA.
</p>
<p>
 These contentions culminated in several orders and preliminary decisions between September 2000 and February 2001, which are briefly related in the Award. The tribunal concluded that it could not prohibit the US from releasing the documents pursuant to its statutory obligation under the FOIA, and agreed that the NAFTA contained no obligation of confidentiality.
</p>
<p>
 However, in view of the arbitration rules, the tribunal also ordered the parties to treat as confidential any other document not subject to such FOIA requests until the conclusion of the proceedings.
</p>
<p>
 Some months later, the NAFTA’s Free Trade Commission’s issued Notes (available
 <a href="http://www.naftaclaims.com/commissionfiles/NAFTA_Comm_1105_Transparency.pdf">
  here
 </a>
 ) that touched on the confidentiality issue. Although these Notes are more famous for their interpretation of NAFTA’s article 1105 (see below), they also confirmed that NAFTA contains no obligation of confidentiality, and embodied the NAFTA parties’ agreement to “make available to the public, in a timely manner, all documents” in NAFTA arbitrations (subject to the redaction of some confidential details).
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Most of the Mondev’s claims stumble on
  <em>
   ratione temporis
  </em>
  jurisdictional objection
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Mondev’s claims were based upon NAFTA’s articles 1110 (expropriation), 1102 (discrimination) and 1105 (minimum standard of treatment).
</p>
<p>
 However, the US objected to the tribunal’s jurisdiction over the claims, arguing that all relevant facts occurred before the entry into force of NAFTA, on January 1, 1994. Furthermore, the respondent stressed that the time bar under NAFTA’s article 1116(2) – which requires investors to bring a claim within three years of having knowledge of the loss or damage – applied to all these claims.
</p>
<p>
 With respect to Mondev’s expropriation and discrimination claims, the tribunal conceded that conduct preceding 1994 could be relevant as part of “continuing breaches”, but stressed that the alleged discrimination or expropriation were necessarily completed before 1994. Thus, the tribunal was barred from deciding these claims.
</p>
<p>
 This left only Mondev’s claim under article 1105 standing, as it related to conduct that occurred both before and after 1994. More precisely, only one aspect of the claim occurred after the entry into force of the NAFTA: the American courts’ treatment of Mondev’s appeals. Since the SJC’s last decision occurred in 1998, the claimant had managed to lodge its claim within the 3 year time window prescribed by NAFTA Chapter 11.
</p>
<p>
 However, the tribunal made clear that it would rule in favour of the investor only if these judicial decisions were breaches of NAFTA in their own right, stressing that “[t]he mere fact that earlier conduct has gone unremedied or unredressed when a treaty enters into force does not justify a tribunal applying the treaty retrospectively to that conduct”.
</p>
<p>
 (As we reported, this holding was cited with approval in the recent
 <a href="http://www.iareporter.com/articles/cafta-time-bar-and-non-retroactivity-rules-largely-eliminate-claims-in-spence-v-costa-rica-but-tribunal-agrees-to-hear-complaints-of-arbitrary-judicial-conduct/">
  Spence Intl v. Costa Rica
 </a>
 award, where the tribunal similarly concluded that it had jurisdiction only to decide if judicial decisions that occurred within the relevant timeframe are a breach of CAFTA in their own right.)
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Even failed investments are internationally-protected investments
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 In a further jurisdictional objection, the US also contested Mondev’s standing. The respondent stressed that the development project failed in 1991; when this happened, LPA’s mortgage over the project was subject to foreclosure, and any rights in the project were allegedly vested in the mortgagor. According to the state, this meant that neither Mondev nor LPA were “investors” in 1994 for NAFTA purposes.
</p>
<p>
 Moreover, because Mondev brought the case in its own name under NAFTA’s article 1116, and not on behalf of LPA under article 1117, the USA stressed that Mondev had failed to prove that it itself suffered damages (as opposed to LPA), and thus lacked standing to bring a claim. (Readers may recall that the NAFTA offers two pathways for investor-state claims, investors can bring claims on their own behalf under Article 1116, or on behalf of an enterprise that they own or control, pursuant to Article 1117.)
</p>
<p>
 For its part, the tribunal noted that NAFTA protects investments even after they have failed – holding otherwise would deprive most NAFTA protections of their effectiveness (such as the prohibition of expropriation). The tribunal also noted that, even after an investment’s failure, at least “[i]ssues of orderly liquidation and the settlement of claims” must still comply with the minimum standard of treatment and in a non-discriminatory manner.
</p>
<p>
 Likewise, the tribunal deemed irrelevant the issue of whether LPA’s rights disappeared with the mortgage’s foreclosure, noting that NAFTA protects failed investments: “[i]n most cases, the dispute submitted to arbitration will concern precisely the question of responsibility for that failure”.
</p>
<p>
 Lastly, arbitrators reasoned that Mondev had undoubted standing to bring the claim under article 1116. The question of whether it itself suffered damages was open to discussion but did not bear on this standing. In the tribunal’s view, the main substantial difference between articles 1116 and 1117 related to the recipient of any compensation: either the foreign investor
 <em>
  or
 </em>
 the local entity on whose behalf the claim was brought. Given its eventual finding that there was no breach, this distinction was irrelevant in the case.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  NAFTA’s Article 1105 incorporates customary international law as it evolved – and nothing more
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 This left only the claims under article 1105 to decide. Yet, this article’s meaning at the time was still unclear.
</p>
<p>
 The Mondev tribunal was the second tribunal to deal with this question following the FTC’s Notes of interpretation. As the award records, the disputing parties, but also Mexico and Canada in third-party submissions, spent a long time discussing the Notes, their relevance to the case, as well as the holdings in
 <em>
  Pope &amp; Talbot v. Canada
 </em>
 (where another NAFTA tribunal considered that it was not bound by the Notes, as they were an amendment to NAFTA, and not a mere interpretation).
</p>
<p>
 Although it refrained from deciding all these issues, the tribunal chose to clarify several contested points. As a first step, it accepted that NAFTA embodied the customary international law standard, but rejected Canada’s suggestion that customary international law was properly captured by the dictum in the 1927
 <em>
  Neer
 </em>
 case. Indeed, the tribunal noted that this case concerned the physical security of aliens, and not foreign investment; besides, the minimum standard evolves with time. “To the modern eye, what is unfair or inequitable need not equate with the outrageous or the egregious.”
</p>
<p>
 The tribunal found support for this evolution within the network of bilateral investment treaties signed in the 20
 <sup>
  th
 </sup>
 century, most of which refer to “fair and equitable treatment” (FET). It reasoned that these treaties constitute state practice, and, together with the decisions of international tribunals, they should help the tribunal to find a standard of “fairness” and “equitable” that is not entirely idiosyncratic.
</p>
<p>
 The award continued that, in this respect, the FTC Notes of interpretation did two things: first they confirmed that the minimum standard under article 1105 was that found in customary international law and not elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
 Second, the Notes made clear that mentions of “fair and equitable treatment”, and “full protection and security” added nothing to the minimum standard. These references in the Notes were not useless, however: they confirmed that these elements, which were precisely those developed by state practice in the 20
 <sup>
  th
 </sup>
 century, were included in the minimum standard as encapsulated by NAFTA.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  A finding of denial of justice requires a “clearly improper and discreditable” judicial outcome
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Pivoting to the merits of the case, the tribunal reasoned that it was only competent to judge if Mondev suffered a denial of justice from the American courts. It accepted that the criterion adopted by the International Court of Justice in
 <em>
  ELSI
 </em>
 in describing arbitrariness (“a wilful disregard of due process of law, … which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of judicial propriety”) was useful in finding a denial of justice.
</p>
<p>
 On this basis, the tribunal found that the proper test was whether, “having regard to generally accepted standards of the administration of justice, a tribunal can conclude in the light of all the available facts that the impugned decision was clearly improper and discreditable […]”. (The “clearly improper and discreditable” standard of denial of justice was later cited by other tribunals as the correct standard to apply under international law (see, e.g., our coverage of
 <a href="http://www.iareporter.com/articles/analysis-tribunal-ruling-in-gea-v-ukraine-offers-contrast-to-earlier-icsid-arbitration-where-non-enforcement-of-arbitral-award-was-at-issue/">
  GEA v. Ukraine
 </a>
 ).)
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Judge-made law is a normal feature of common law jurisdictions, and not necessarily a denial of justice
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 The SJC had decided that LPA’s contractual claims were dependent on whether it performed the contract sufficiently to put the city in breach.
</p>
<p>
 Mondev had three grounds to challenge the propriety of this judgment. First it advanced that the SJC seriously departed from its own jurisprudence and in effect applied a “new rule”. In so doing, the court also appeared to refuse to treat the city as it would any other contractual party (indeed, the SJC had cited a dictum from Justice Holmes to the effect that “[m]en must turn square corners when they deal with the Government”).
</p>
<p>
 Mondev’s second argument lay in the SJC’s refusal, once it made its finding in law, to remand fact-finding questions to a jury. Thirdly, and in any case, Mondev took issue with the SJC’s retroactive application of its “new rule”.
</p>
<p>
 The tribunal was “unimpressed” by the claimant’s first ground; it found nothing shocking or surprising in the SJC’s reasoning on LPA’s contractual claims, and the “square corners” dictum was at most subsidiary to the court’s decision.
</p>
<p>
 Yet crucially, even if the SJC had applied a “new rule”, the tribunal stressed that this is normal and expected in a common law jurisdiction. The same goes for the alleged retroactivity of this “new rule”.
</p>
<p>
 Lastly, the arbitrators refused to find a procedural denial of justice in the SJC’s decision not to remand the case: in its view, the application of such “local procedural rules” fall on local courts to decide, and could not violate article 1105, except in “extreme cases”. Likewise, it is “normally a matter for local courts to determine whether and in what circumstances to apply new decisional law retrospectively”.
</p>
<p>
 Readers will be reminded of the pending NAFTA case in Eli Lilly v. Canada, where the arguments centre around an alleged change of patent regulations by Canadian courts.

  As we reported
 </a>
 , the parties have debated the teachings of the Mondev award, and its lessons could be a matter that the arbitrators must grapple with.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Grant of immunity to state agency not a treaty breach in itself
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Finally, the investor contested the propriety of BRA’s immunity for intentional torts that prevented the jury verdict to be entered against it. The investor contended that shielding one public authority from suit in respect of NAFTA breaches was, in itself, a breach of article 1105.
</p>
<p>
 After taking inspiration from case-law from the European Court of Human Rights, and recording the parties’ debate over state practice in granting immunities to public bodies, the tribunal ultimately rejected the claimant’s analysis. If BRA’s immunity had shielded it in the local proceedings, it was from a verdict in tort and contractual matters, i.e., not from breaches of NAFTA. Indeed, the tribunal noted that immunity would not apply before a NAFTA tribunal. Thus, if a claimant were to lodge a claim (that otherwise fell within a tribunal’s jurisdiction) it could allege that the conduct of the locally-immune entity had triggered a breach of NAFTA protections.
</p>
<p>
 On a different note, while the tribunal conceded that “… circumstances can be envisaged where the conferral of a general immunity from suit for conduct of a public authority affecting a NAFTA investment could amount to a breach of Article 1105(1) of NAFTA”, the tribunal nevertheless concluded that “… [W]ithin broad limits, the extent to which a State decides to immunize regulatory authorities from suit for interference with contractual relations is a matter for the competent organs of the State to decide.”
</p>
<p>
 Although Mondev’s claims all failed, the tribunal noted in conclusion that it had “some sympathy” for the company’s ultimate situation, and slightly rebuked the city and BRA’s actions in the underlying dispute. Accordingly, each party bore its own costs and was ordered to pay half of the expenses for the tribunal and ICSID management.
