Failure to register parallel, English law SPAs not serious enough to deny the investment treaty protection   A similar analysis was given to Uzbekistan’s argument that the English SPAs should have been registered with the TSE, under three legal instruments. While the majority was doubtful that this was really mandated under Uzbek law (whose lack of clarity the majority again stressed), it concluded that the alleged violation was not serious enough to warrant an adverse jurisdictional holding.  This conclusion was notably based on the sanctions associated with the failure to register. While parties sparred over the sanction provided in one of the legal instrument (Order No. 2003-08), the majority eventually found in favour of the claimants, in that the proper translation of the order provided for the “invalidity” of the transaction (and not it being “null and void”). The milder sanction indicated, the majority held, the lower importance of the rule.  In that respect, the majority stressed that claimants’ expert had a background in law whereas the respondent’s expert had his in economics, and found “significant” that the respondent did not take the opportunity to call and cross-examine the claimants’ expert. (In a paragraph, the anonymous dissenter found that the lesser sanction provided under local law could not diminish the gravity of the claimants’ purposeful avoidance of Uzbek laws, and did not share the majority’s assessment of the respondent’s expert’s credibility.)
