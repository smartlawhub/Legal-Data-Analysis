Tribunal sees a distinction between internationally wrongful acts and the continuing effects of such acts   Pakistan’s last objection was a temporal one: the Italy-Pakistan BIT entered into force on June 22, 2001 – i.e., after some of the acts underlying Impregilo’s claims. In the state’s view, this put these acts beyond the arbitration’s jurisdictional scope.  This argument was successful, and the tribunal rejected the claimant’s contention that all allegedly harmful acts were covered given their “continuing character”. In the tribunal’s view, there was a difference between the alleged wrongful act and its effects; simply because the latter may enter the BIT’s temporal scope does not entail that the underlying acts should be judged in view of legal protections that did not apply at the time.  As a result, the tribunal found that it had jurisdiction only regarding acts that occurred after June 22, 2001 – without however, at this stage, determining which acts in particular were included or excluded.  Questions of costs were reserved for the merits phase.  As noted above, the case settled after the jurisdictional decision was handed down.
