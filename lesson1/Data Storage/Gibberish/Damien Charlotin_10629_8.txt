Tribunal finds breach of FET standard   Given the facts summarised above, the tribunal swiftly found that Tucumán had mounted, “improperly and without justification […] an illegitimate ‘campaign’ against the concession, the Concession Agreement, and the ‘foreign’ concessionaire.” The tribunal found support, among other pieces of evidence, in a case study commissioned by the World Bank, where one of Argentina’s own witnesses described extensively the politically-motivated actions of the local authorities. For the tribunal, these actions, notably in their response to the turbidity incident, were “irresponsible, unreasonable and disproportionate.”  The tribunal specified that the province was in its right to reverse the privatisation process, but held that “it is clearly wrong (and unfair and inequitable in terms of the BIT) to seek to bring a concessionaire to the renegotiation table through threats of rescission based on colourable allegations after having wrongly deprived the concessionaire’s billings of formal legitimacy.” (For an interesting parallel, see our analysis of the Nordzucker v. Poland award, which also involved public officials getting cold feet over a privatization process.)  For the tribunal, the “politically driven arm-twisting” pursued by the local authorities “had a devastating effect” on the economic viability of Vivendi’s investment. At the very least, it undermined the claimants’ legitimate expectations that the province would not mount an “illegitimate campaign against them.”
