Dissenter would have seen a contract   In a dissenting opinion, arbitrator Arbitrator 
   explained that, contrary to findings of the majority, a contract existed in the case. Of course, the dissenter said, if the question is whether there existed an instrument solemnly denominated “contract,” the answer was no – but civil law allows for informal contracts when there is coincidence of the parties’ wills.  And in this respect, the dissenter saw a contract in the various agreements and instruments adopted by the parties, the provisions of which went much further than would require a mere declaration of intention. That the domestic companies eventually faltered did not mean, according to the dissenter, that they were unable to constitute an investment – especially when the facts underlying these failures are exactly what the tribunal was called upon to determine. For example, although GFHC did not contribute the required capital to INCOGESA, this could be explained by the political “uncertainty” prevailing at the time – indeed by the very “risk” the majority thought did not sufficiently exist here.  The dissenter also rejected the majority’s view that the investor ought to have known domestic law better, and stressed that, in cases where an investor deals with the government directly, the latter would have an obligation to ensure that domestic processes and laws are complied with.
