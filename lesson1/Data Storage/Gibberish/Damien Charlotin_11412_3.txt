Before Paris Court, Kyrgyz Republic restates its allegations on money laundering   A substantial part of the Kyrgyz Republic’s defence in the underlying BIT arbitration was based on allegations of money laundering related to Manas Bank’s operations. Indeed, ongoing criminal proceedings targeted at Manas Bank’s activity and management in Kyrgyzstan punctuated the arbitral proceedings, with the Kyrgyz Republic seeking twice to stay the arbitral proceedings – unsuccessfully.  As noted above, the tribunal were sympathetic to the view that money laundering, if proven, might derail an investor’s claim and justify some extraordinary state behaviour. However, the arbitrators ultimately held that the respondent did not discharge its burden of proof. In that respect, the tribunal stressed that the Kyrgyz Republic’s own officials had been rebuked at two stages by the Kyrgyz Courts for failing (at those junctures) to marshal enough evidence to bear out the charges.  Acknowledging this setback, the Kyrgyz Republic explained it by the difficulty of gathering evidence in this kind of criminal case, and the protection that Mr Belokon allegedly enjoyed due to his relationship with the former Kyrgyz President’s (powerful) son. By the time that the Kyrgyz Republic was making its set-aside case before the Paris Court of Appeal, the respondent professed to have gathered more evidence to bear out its allegations of money-laundering.
