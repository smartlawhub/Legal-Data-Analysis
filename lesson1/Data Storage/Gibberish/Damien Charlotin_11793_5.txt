Deference not a breach of equality between the parties   The claimant then sought to challenge the tribunal’s statement that review under NAFTA article 1105 included “a good level of deference to the manner in which a state regulates its internal affairs.” In the claimant’s view, the tribunal here exceeded its authority and breached the requirement that parties to the arbitration be treated equally.  The Court however found the claimant’s cavils to be misguided: the tribunal was not here accepting without much review Canada’s legal arguments or factual assertions, “as that term [deference] is usually used in U.S. law.”* On the contrary, the tribunal “exhaustively” reviewed Canada’s actions under NAFTA’s article 1105.  For the Court, the tribunal’s “deference” was merely “an acknowledgment that a government is entitled to make policy choices that are not perfectly rational.” It embodies the opinion that under NAFTA’s standards of protection, imperfect policy choices are not necessarily unfair or inequitable or otherwise in breach of the minimum standard.  Once again, the court stressed that Mr. Brower’s dissent supported this conclusion, as he accepted the majority’s premises but came to a different conclusion on the merits. For the Court, the investor was again merely disagreeing with respect to the interpretation of the law – here, article 1105 –, and not providing evidence of the tribunal misbehaving, exceeding its authority or manifestly disregarding the law.
