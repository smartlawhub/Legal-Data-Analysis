Contract’s forum selection clause irrelevant for the tribunal’s jurisdiction   More potent was Argentina’s argument based on article 16(4) of the Concession Agreement: a forum selection clause that referred any dispute to the administrative courts of Tucumán.  Yet, the tribunal found that article 16(4) did not waive the investors’ rights under the BIT, including their right to submit the dispute to arbitration for claims that included breaches of the BIT – as opposed to contractual breaches. In so doing, the tribunal relied in particular on the only precedent involving Argentina at the time, Lanco v. Argentina , where a tribunal had upheld its jurisdiction despite a similar clause in the contract at issue in that case.
