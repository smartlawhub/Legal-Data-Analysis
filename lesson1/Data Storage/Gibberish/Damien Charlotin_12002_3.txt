Development project fails to take off   The dispute finds its roots in a 2008 project to develop a large set of buildings, facilities and accommodations in Malabo and Bata (two of Equatorial Guinea’s main cities). In view of this project, the claimant and officials signed a letter of intention in January 2008, before signing several agreements providing for the constitution of a joint company in late 2008. However, the procurement contract contemplated in these agreements failed to materialise and the project never got off the ground.  Despite these difficulties, GFHC won a bid in 2011 for another development project in the city of Oyala. However, again, the project failed to materialize, following the granting of the concession to the claimant  The claimant sent its notice of dispute in 2012, later opting for an arbitration under ICSID’s Additional Facility Rules. The final Award on Jurisdiction is dated December 4, 2015, and is available here (as explained below, the tribunal signed the award earlier that year).
