 , we reported on Mexico’s failed bid to have its NAFTA dispute with Canadian investor Lion Mexico Consolidated LP dismissed on an expedited basis.
</p>
<p>
 Since then, the tribunal of Juan Fernandez-Armesto, David J.A. Cairns and Ricardo Ramirez Hernandez has released a new decision on May 29, 2017 [

 ] partly granting Mexico’s request to bifurcate the case to decide the jurisdictional objection at the heart of the earlier expedited proceedings.
</p>
<p>
 The claimant is assisted by Mayer Brown, Mexico by government counsel.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Only one of Mexico’s two objections will be decided in the bifurcated proceedings
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Mexico had two jurisdictional objections in support of its request for bifurcation.
</p>
<p>
 The first objection was
 <em>
  ratione materiae
 </em>
 , as the state contended that Lion’s investment (mortgages and promissory notes that served as collateral to a loan) did not qualify as an investment under NAFTA’s articles 1101 and 1139. (

  Readers will recall
 </a>
 that Mexico’s unsuccessful attempt to dismiss the claims on an expedited basis relied on the very same objection.)
</p>
<p>
 Second, Mexico argued that the dispute should be governed by NAFTA’s Chapter 14 (“financial services”) and not Chapter 11 (“investment”). Chapter 14 incorporates many investor protections from Chapter 11, including the availability of investor-state arbitration, but this does not include the fair and equitable treatment standard at the basis of some of Lion’s claims (nor an equivalent provision). According to Mexico, the tribunal would lack jurisdiction over these claims.
</p>
<p>
 Ultimately, the tribunal agreed to bifurcate the proceedings and to hear Mexico’s first objection, observing that, if successful, the objection could “extinguish all the claims” and that it was not intertwined with the merits.*
</p>
<p>
 However, the tribunal reasoned that the second objection did not warrant bifurcation, because it is not susceptible of putting an end to the case, but would merely alter the dispute’s scope and claims. Besides, Mexico had admitted that, were the second objection upheld, a dedicated phase of document production would be likely necessary – something that would run counter to the “principle of procedural economy and cost efficiency” according to the tribunal.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Change of seat request denied
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Mexico also renewed its request in favour of Toronto as the seat of the arbitration over Washington, DC (the tribunal had decided this issue in an earlier procedural order, see
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/articles/arbitrators-nix-mexicos-bid-to-dismiss-nafta-case-on-expedited-basis-and-also-decline-to-view-canadian-claimant-as-effectively-american-for-purposes-of-deciding-on-a-neutral-seat/">

 </a>
 ). Mexico explained that it was “now clear” that Lion is nothing but an investment vehicle for US interests, with no “real ties” to Canada, making a Canadian seat the most neutral option.
</p>
<p>
 The tribunal rejected the request as untimely, unconnected to “the issue at this procedural stage,” and saw no need to alter its previous decision regarding the arbitration’s seat, as the facts and legal basis underpinning it had not changed.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
 * However, the tribunal also reserved itself the possibility to join the jurisdictional phase with the merits “at any time after the presentation of the last submission on the jurisdictional issues.”
