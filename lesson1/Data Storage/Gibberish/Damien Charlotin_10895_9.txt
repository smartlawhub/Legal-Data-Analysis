Alleged breaches of Transnational Public Policy are not part of legality analysis   Finally, the state argued that the claimants’ conduct in concealing part of the transaction was additionally a violation of transnational public policy, that requires “truthful and accurate disclosures” and prohibits alleged manipulations. However, the tribunal concluded that the legality requirement only covered the laws of Uzbekistan, and not this alleged transnational public policy.  As a result, the tribunal dismissed Uzbekistan’s third jurisdictional objection by majority.  As a final note, this finding allowed the majority to side-step the claimants’ defence that Uzbekistan was estopped from making this third jurisdictional objection, as it knew all along of the alleged incorrect price (a strategy that has proved fruitful for the claimant in Fraport v Philippines (II) , in circumstances where the state publicly supported a project that it later deemed illegal). The anonymous dissenter briefly explained that he was unconvinced by the claimants’ estoppel argument.   In a third article , we report on the respondent’s fourth and last objection, concerning the alleged corruption that tainted the investment’s establishment.
