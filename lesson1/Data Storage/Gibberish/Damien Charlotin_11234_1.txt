In Tatneft v Ukraine award, tribunal sees breach of FET in the totality of the record but awards only the price originally paid by the investor     [Editor’s note: this is the second part in a pair of articles discussing the award in Tatneft v Ukraine; the first part, dealing at length with the factual background of the case,  and the tribunal’s appraisal of the facts, can be found here .]   In an introductory article , we reported on the (complicated) factual findings of the tribunal in Tatneft v Ukraine, whose award was recently brought to light following enforcement proceedings in the US.  The dispute stemmed from, and centres on the events through which Tatneft’s stake in a Ukrainian refinery had been wiped-out. The refinery is owned by Ukrtatnafta, an erstwhile joint-venture between Ukrainian and Tatarstan interests. For ease of comprehension, the award depicts a struggle between two warring camps: Tatarstan’s side of the joint-venture (“the Tatarstan parties”, among which figures the claimant Tatneft), and the Ukrainian side.  Below, we report on the liability and damages findings of the tribunal composed of Arbitrator 
   (claimant’s appointee), Arbitrator 
   (respondent’s appointee), and Arbitrator 
   (chair by agreement of the co-arbitrators).  As we note below, Ukraine’s actions were assessed primarily through the lens of a broadly-construed fair and equitable treatment obligation. At the damages phase, Ukraine was ultimately ordered to compensate Tatneft for the price paid for its initial investment.
