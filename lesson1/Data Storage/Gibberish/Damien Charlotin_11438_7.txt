Tribunal finds investment in claims under a contract…   Yemen’s next jurisdictional objection was ratione materiae : the state contested that BUCG had an investment in the first place, as it merely had “to provide a performance guarantee” under the contract. Yemen also contested the legality of BUCG’s investment, and the fact that it had been made in its territory.  Reflecting on the interpretation of “investment” under the ICSID Convention and the BIT, the arbitrators noted that a middle way had developed between the view of the Joy Mining tribunal (the so-called “double-keyhole test”, whereby a claimant must have an investment under the meanings of both treaties) and that of the Malaysia Historical Salvors  ad hoc annulment committee (according to which the BIT was the primary text to consider). The middle way focuses on the BIT’s definition of investment, but concedes that ICSID tribunals must not assert jurisdiction in cases where this definition is in excess of what is permissible under the ICSID Convention.  In the tribunal’s view, the inclusion of “claims to any performance having an economic value” in the BIT clearly did not exceed the permissible definition of an investment under the ICSID Convention. Thus, the tribunal had “no difficulty” in finding that BUCG had an investment.  (The tribunal did not seem to answer, however, Yemen’s objection that the investment had not been made “in accordance with its laws and regulations,” because it had not been registered under the state’s investment laws. However, the award answered a similar objection at an earlier juncture, when it dismissed as unfounded Yemen’s view that such registration was a condition precedent to investment protection under the BIT.)
