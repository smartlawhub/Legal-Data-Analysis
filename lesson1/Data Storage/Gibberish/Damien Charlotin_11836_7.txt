Treaty claims are distinct from, and can then overlap with, contract claims   Turning to Pakistan’s objection regarding the alleged coincidence of the treaty claims with the contract claims, the tribunal found that this was irrelevant, as the facts giving rise to a contract claim could at the same time give rise to a treaty claim.  The tribunal further explained that ordinary contract breaches would normally not count as treaty breaches. However, breaches attributable to the state acting in its capacity as a state (and not as a commercial party), that is, breaches involving the state’s exercise of sovereign powers, could reach that threshold. The tribunal noted that this distinction recalled that between acts from instrumentalities that are attributable to the state, and those that are not (see above).  Applied to the facts, these considerations allowed the tribunal to find that it had jurisdiction to decide most of Impregilo’s claims on the merits (a few claims were not substantiated enough to permit an analysis, and the tribunal postponed a decision on these to the merits phase). The only exceptions concerned some claims that were concurrently being adjudicated in arbitration proceedings in Pakistan, under the contract’s arbitration clause, and which did not involve Pakistan’s exercise of sovereign power.
