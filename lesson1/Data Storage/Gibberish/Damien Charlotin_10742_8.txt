Ceiling on return could not breach legitimate expectations when it is superior to the investor’s own expected return   The investor also contested the introduction, with the Spanish 2013 measures, of a ceiling to the “reasonable rate of return” of the renewable energy plants.  However, the tribunal found that the claimant’s own expected rate of return when it invested was below this ceiling, even after taxes. Based on a 2011 expert report by Deloitte submitted on behalf of the claimant’s Spanish parent in its recourse before the Spanish domestic courts, the tribunal concluded that Isolux expected a 6.19% rate of return when it invested.  Since this was lower than the ceiling, the tribunal refused to credit Isolux’s claim that the ceiling breached its legitimate expectations.
