Tribunal sets interest rate as LIBOR +4%, with no regard to Venezuela’s borrowing costs   The BITs provided for interest to be paid on the sums awarded. While the Luxembourg-Venezuela treaty referred to “normal commercial rates”, the Portugal-Venezuela treaty specified that it should be a rate in use in Venezuela.  In the tribunal’s view, this ruled out both the WACC rate advanced by the claimants, and the rate of a safe investment (10-years US Treasury bonds) advocated by Venezuela.  Rather, the tribunal quickly settled on the LIBOR rate for US deposits +4%. While Venezuela pushed for an added margin of only 2%, the tribunal reasoned that in the current circumstances, where interest rates are unusually low (or even negative), 4% was more adequate. Compounded annually, this would be the same rate for pre-award and post-award interest.   As we reported on the very different rates adopted by arbitrators in recent disputes involving Venezuela, the rate is a relatively generous one. Finally, it is worth noting that the tribunal gave no consideration to Venezuela’s borrowing costs in its finding (although the investors mentioned it in their pleadings). This is consistent with the approach taken by recent tribunals, although not, seemingly , the tribunal in the first dispute opposing these parties.
