Dismissal of board chairman precedes subsequent “raid” on Ukrtatnafta by Kolomoisky interests   Frictions in Ukrtatnafta’s management first emerged in 2004 when Ukrtatnafta’s Supervisory Board dismissed the Chairman of the Management Board, Mr Ovcharenko. Although a Ukrainian court swiftly reinstated him, his reinstatement lasted only one day before Ukrtatnafta’s shareholders dismissed him again.  Mr Ovcharenko would ride back into power in 2007 – and to the ultimate detriment of the Tatarstan/Tatneft faction.  In 2007, Mr Ovcharenko reverted to the very same court that had earlier called for his reinstatement as board chairman. He sought a supplementary decision and interim measures (designed to facilitate enforcement). These were granted on an ex parte basis, on the reasoning that the earlier 2004 ruling on his reinstatement had not been implemented.  In October 2007, armed with these favourable rulings, Mr Ovcharenko entered the Ukrtatnafta refinery premises with a state bailiff and a group of men, some apparently armed, and was reinstated as Chairman. Troops from the Ministry of the Interior were thereafter posted at the refinery.  Mr Ovcharenko then proceeded to accumulate power and side-line the Tatarstan side of the management board, instead installing individuals affiliated to Privat Group on the board, with the minority of seats held by Ukraine’s Naftogaz. Meanwhile, as a result of court decisions discussed in more detail below, most shares were cumulatively gathered in the hands of Korsan and other entities close to Privat Group, while the Tatarstan side’s interests were progressively extinguished.  An investigation into the October 2007 take-over at the refinery was opened by a local official of the Ministry of the Interior, but was quashed in May 2008 – on the motion, the claimant alleged, of high-ranking Ukrainian officials.
