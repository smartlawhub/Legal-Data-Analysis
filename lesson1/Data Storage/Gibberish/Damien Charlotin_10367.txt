<p>
 As readers may recall, Tatneft is one of the largest producers of crude oil in Russia, and had a 22.7% direct and indirect stake in Ukrtatnafta, a Ukrainian company owning an oil refinery in Kremenchug. Following the loss of these shares due to a “raid” by Ukrainian oligarch Igor Kolomoisky, Tatneft was later awarded more than $112 million in damages by the tribunal which found that Ukraine’s courts and prosecutors facilitated the raid.

 for the (complicated) factual background to the case.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Ukrtatnafta Treaty does not bar BIT arbitration
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 As we explained
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/articles/in-long-confidential-russia-ukraine-bit-award-tribunal-reviews-evidence-of-alleged-black-raid-by-oligarch-facilitated-by-ukraines-courts-and-prosecutor/">
  in our prior reporting
 </a>
 on the dispute’s factual background, Ukrtatnafta was founded by a 1995 Treaty between Ukraine and Tatarstan. The Treaty contemplated the initial “parity” of the parties with respect to the joint-venture, with 50% of the shares reserved to the Tatarstan side and the Ukrainian side.
</p>
<p>
 The Treaty also included its own dispute-settlement mechanisms, including for disputes between the states’ business entities, which should be heard by the relevant local courts. When Tatneft later sued under the BIT, Ukraine argued that the Ukrtatnafta Treaty was
 <em>
  lex specialis
 </em>
 between the parties, thus superseding the BIT.
</p>
<p>
 In reply, the tribunal stressed that there was some difficulty in deciding which treaty was
 <em>
  lex specialis
 </em>
 in this case. The relevant criteria, in the tribunal’s analysis, was the nature of the dispute: since it concerned business and investment activities and opposed an investor to the state, it fell more naturally under the ambit of the BIT. Besides, as the dispute involved more parties than Ukraine and Tatarstan, it went beyond the framework of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty and the “diplomatic” disputes contemplated thereunder.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Tatneft is not “controlled” by the Republic of Tatarstan
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Ukraine next objected that Tatneft was controlled by the Republic of Tatarstan, and therefore not an investor under the BIT.
</p>
<p>
 The state proposed two tests supporting this conclusion: under a “structural test”, Ukraine stressed that the Republic owns a “golden share” in Tatneft with special privileges, while its Prime Minister chairs the Board of Directors. Under a “functional test,” Tatneft was used by the Republic to pursue some public policies and social undertakings, and had contributed to the Republic’s budget. According to Ukraine, this was notably revealed by Tatneft itself in filings with the United States SEC: “the Tatarstan government is able to exercise considerable influence over us.”
</p>
<p>
 In Ukraine’s view, Tatneft was thus a governmental entity, and the definition of “investor” in the Russia-Ukraine BIT does not encompass such entities.
</p>
<p>
 Yet the tribunal did not deem it necessary to decide this last point, instead accepting the claimant’s insistence that it was not, in fact, controlled by the Republic of Tatarstan.
</p>
<p>
 Looking at the structural test, the tribunal noted that the “aspects of government presence” identified by Ukraine could not detract from the fact that the Republic only owned 36% of Tatneft’s shares (additional allegations that further stakes were owned indirectly, or by individuals close to the Tatarstan government, were deemed unsubstantiated).
</p>
<p>
 Ukraine was not more successful with respect to the functional test; the elements identified by Ukraine were deemed “marginal,” while Tatneft’s core activities were commercial in nature.
</p>
<p>
 In the tribunal’s view, Tatneft’s situation was typical of the “transition” of erstwhile state-owned companies in the context of the former Soviet Republics’ conversion to market economies. “Because of its past close connection with the Tatar Government, it is perhaps inevitable that some of these policy elements might have survived in Tatneft, but again that does not mean that the company loses its essential commercial aims.” The filings with the SEC were held to refer only to past events, and for the tribunal it is in the nature of such filings to disclose investment risks, including the risk of undue influence by the government.*
</p>
<p>
 Since Tatneft was not controlled by the government, there was no need to decide or prejudge whether “public entities” are allowed to claim under the Russia-Ukraine BIT.
</p>
<p>
 (This is however a question likely to surface in the context of a
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/articles/tribunals-finalized-in-two-russian-related-investment-treaty-arbitrations-icsid-and-uncitral-with-boeckstiegel-once-again-in-a-familiar-role/">
  more recently-filed arbitration
 </a>
 between Ukraine and the Republic of Tatarstan, relating to the latter’s own separate shareholding interest in Ukrtatnafta.**)
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Investments steered, in part, by political considerations are not excluded from BIT’s scope
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 The tribunal also dismissed Ukraine’s argument that Tatneft’s investment in Ukrtatnafta did not qualify as an investment under the BIT because the contributions to Ukrtatnafta had been decided at the political level in the framework of the Treaty.
</p>
<p>
 The tribunal refused to read additional requirements into the BIT’s definition of investment, or to enter into an examination of the motives of the investment. In any case, the award adopted the claimant’s view that the investment had both public and private purposes. This could be, again, attributed to the “the transition period between the command economies of the past and the market economies of the present.”
</p>
<p>
 Ultimately, Tatneft’s interest and activities with respect to Ukrtatnafta were, “in their essence, commercially-oriented.” This was enough to qualify as an investment under the BIT.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Illegality objection fails to find traction
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Ukraine’s final objection to jurisdiction focused on the alleged illegality of Tatneft’s investment in Ukrtatnafta. Ukraine cited Tatneft’s non-compliance with a thirty-day period in the 1995 Treaty for the respective “contributions” of the shareholders to be made. Ukraine also pointed to Ukrainian securities laws that mandate prompt payment for shares. On the facts, Ukraine noted that Tatneft had belatedly paid for its shares, and only after shareholders resolutions allowed Tatneft to alter the very nature of its contribution to the venture.
</p>
<p>
 Even more potent in Ukraine’s view was the fact that Tatneft’s actions breached the “parity” requirement of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty. Tatneft allied at one point with two foreign, minority shareholders, AmRuz and Seagroup, in order to control 55% of the voting rights.
</p>
<p>
 In reviewing the objection, the tribunal interpreted the “legality” requirement as applying only to the initiation of the investment, and seemed to agree with the tribunal in
 <em>
  L.E.S.I v Algeria
 </em>
 that it concerned only
 <em>
  fundamental
 </em>
 principles of the host State’s legislation.
</p>
<p>
 On this basis, the tribunal was unconvinced that Tatneft’s acquisition of shares was tainted by illegality. At no point was this alleged illegality raised earlier in the context of Ukrtatnafta’s management, and the shareholders all agreed to the modification of Tatneft’s contribution. The remedy contemplated under Ukrainian securities laws was a fine, and the right of the company to dispose of the unpaid shares – something Ukrtatnafta never did. Lastly, the tribunal found that illegality claims under Ukrainian law were time-barred by a Ukrainian three-year statute of limitations. (The tribunal did not elaborate on the interplay between this domestic law statute of limitations and the BIT’s legality requirements.)
</p>
<p>
 As to the “parity” requirement, the tribunal interpreted the Treaty as mandating equal ownership of the company, by the Ukrainian and Tatarstan sides, only at the
 <em>
  outset
 </em>
 of its incorporation.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  No abuse of process in acquiring entities already protected under another investment treaty
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 In addition to its jurisdictional objections, Ukraine presented three objections to Tatneft’s claims’ admissibility.
</p>
<p>
 The first admissibility objection concerned Tatneft’s indirect stake in Ukrtatnafta. Tatneft had taken control of Seagroup and AmRuz (two minority shareholders) in December 2007, thereby acquiring an additional 18% stake in Ukrtatnafta.
</p>
<p>
 Ukraine challenged the timing of these acquisitions, to the extent that the measures Tatneft complained of had already happened: in May 2007, a Ukrainian court ordered AmRuz and Seagroup to hand over their shares to Ukrtatnafta as a provisional measure in one set of proceedings. In the second half of 2007, a second set of proceedings saw the Kiev courts – at first instance and appeal – rule on the invalidity of Seagroup’s and AmRuz’s share purchase agreements.
</p>
<p>
 Ukraine then contended that Tatneft’s acquisition of these interests, arising
 <em>
  after
 </em>
 the dispute, was performed for forum-shopping purposes. (Reader will recall that corporate restructuring can derail a claim if deemed abusive – see, e.g., the award in
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/articles/philip-morris-v-australia-award-surfaces-tribunal-adopted-looser-test-of-abuse-than-seen-in-pac-rim-case-and-deemed-investors-corporate-restructuring-to-be-abusive/">
  Philip Morris v Australia
 </a>
 .)
</p>
<p>
 This objection failed on two accounts. First, the tribunal noted that “at least some of the alleged harm” to Tatneft’s indirect investment occurred after its acquisition. While taking due note of the two sets of proceedings identified by Ukraine, the tribunal found that it was a third set of proceedings, initiated in February 2008, that definitively invalidated the share purchase agreements. By contrast, the first two sets of proceedings were temporary in nature, and susceptible of being overturned at the time of the acquisition.
</p>
<p>
 Second, and in any case, the tribunal was unpersuaded that the claimant’s actions were abusive. AmRuz and Seagroup sent their own notice of dispute in June 2008, under the Ukraine-US BIT and the Energy Charter Treaty respectively. At the direction of Tatneft, these disputes were eventually discontinued to bring all claims under the Russia-Ukraine BIT.
</p>
<p>
 In the tribunal’s view, this was not an abuse, as there is no indication that the standards of protection under these treaties were inferior to those under the Russia-Ukraine BIT. Compared to precedents where abuse barred admissibility, Tatneft was “not substituting a status of protected investor for that of an investor which otherwise is not entitled to protection, which is the essence of forum shopping.” (We’ve
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/articles/arbitrators-allow-investor-to-cure-a-crystalised-abuse-of-process-by-choosing-to-drop-one-of-two-sets-of-parallel-bit-arbitration-claims/">
  written recently
 </a>
 about a case where Mr Orrego Vicuna also sits and where an abuse did arise – but where arbitrators gave the claimants the opportunity to cure this abuse.)
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Unpaid oil deliveries could be consequential damages arising from Ukraine’s breaches
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Ukraine’s second admissibility objection concerned Tatneft’s claim for unpaid oil deliveries. In Ukraine’s view, this was a contractual matter, to which Ukraine was not privy, and which could not be resolved by the tribunal.
</p>
<p>
 Unpersuaded, the tribunal accepted Tatneft’s contention that its claims concerned consequential damages, and were moreover linked to a whole set of facts surrounding the Kremenchug refinery and Ukraine’s treaty breaches. As such, this claim could be resolved only at the merits stage. (
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/articles/in-tatneft-v-ukraine-award-tribunal-sees-breach-of-fet-in-the-totality-of-the-record-but-awards-only-the-price-originally-paid-by-the-investor/">
  As we reported
 </a>
 , this particular claim failed ultimately due to lack of causality.)
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Unusually-worded MFN clause still reaches into other treaty protections
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Lastly, Ukraine objected that Tatneft failed to state an arguable,
 <em>
  prima facie
 </em>
 case under the BIT.
</p>
<p>
 In Ukraine’s view, the rather unique “complete and unconditional legal protection” treaty standard on which the claimant relied could not be breached because the claimant had been able to enforce its legal protections before Ukrainian courts. Further, Ukraine stressed that the MFN clause on which the claimant sought to rely to import the fair and equitable treatment standard from the Ukraine-UK BIT (under which Tatneft’s claims would eventually succeed) referred to MFN for the “regime for the investments” and not MFN “treatment.” Ukraine argued that Tatneft was thus unable to import the fair and equitable treatment standard via this type of MFN clause.
</p>
<p>
 However, the tribunal was satisfied that the claimant had made a
 <em>
  prima facie
 </em>
 claim, which was thus admissible. The interpretation of these two provisions was postponed to the merits.***
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 * Filings with the SEC seems to have limited evidentiary value in investment cases: in
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/articles/damages-in-second-case-brought-to-icsid-by-tenaris-and-talta-a-discounted-cashflow-dcf-valuation-is-embraced-by-arbitrators/">
  Tenaris v Venezuela
 </a>
 , a tribunal had similarly held that some disclosure by the claimant in SEC filings were irrelevant, and best explained by accounting considerations.
</p>
<p>
 ** The award records that the Republic of Tatarstan had already submitted a “cooling-off” letter with reference to the Russia-Ukraine BIT prior to 2010. Ukraine contended in its pleadings submissions that “in any event Tatarstan’s claim could only be dealt with under the inter-governmental dispute settlement arrangements of the Ukrtatnafta Treaty and not under the Russia-Ukraine BIT.”
</p>
<p>
 *** The tribunal noted that the claimant, in filing for arbitration, had already relied on the MFN clause: Tatneft imported the “more favorable treatment” provided in the Ukraine-UK BIT, which requires a three-month waiting period following the notification of the dispute, while the Russia-Ukraine BIT asks for a six-month period. Ukraine apparently did not object to this use of the MFN clause, notwithstanding the debates about the applicability of MFN clauses to procedural requirements (see, e.g.,
