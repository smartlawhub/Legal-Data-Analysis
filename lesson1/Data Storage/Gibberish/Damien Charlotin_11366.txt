 As Gabriel Resources v. Romania arbitration plays out, arbitrators have weighed in on power to order “emergency” interim relief in relation to local tax and fraud investigations

 The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) has recently posted a series of documents pertaining to two earlier requests for provisional measures that opened the case of Gabriel Resources Ltd. and Gabriel Resources (Jersey) Ltd against Romania.
</p>
<p>
 The release of the documents (which include the parties’ redacted submissions as well as the full transcript of the hearing dedicated to the requests) comes as a result of transparency requirements contained in the Canada-Romania BIT, under which the case was brought. The case is also seeing claims for breach of the Romania-UK BIT.

 The case, which concerns Gabriel Resources’ alleged investment in a gold mining project in the region of Roșia Montană, has elicited controversy, notably from environmental groups. The record reveals that the tribunal received, shortly after its constitution, a letter from several organisations seeking permission to submit
 <em>
  amicus curiae
 </em>
 submissions.

  Tribunal pushes for the parties’ collaboration in answering first request for provisional measures
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 The claimants’ first request (dated June 16, 2016) concerned several hundreds of documents in possession of the Roşia Montană Gold Corporation SA (RMGC), the Romanian project company in which the claimants have an 80% stake (the remaining 20% is owned by Romanian state-owned entities).
</p>
<p>
 The documents at issue in the request were covered by various confidentiality requirements under Romanian law which have hindered their use by Gabriel Resources in these proceedings. The claimants indicated that, one year after the registration of the request for arbitration, Romania’s inaction in relaxing the confidentiality obligations had compelled them to seek provisional measures from the tribunal.
</p>
<p>
 This request appears to have spurred Romania to action, with the tribunal observing that, by the time of the hearing, the parties had collaborated such that only a few documents still needed release and declassification by the Romanian authorities.
</p>
<p>
 The claimants’ full access to the declassified documents was however still hindered pending the signature of a confidentiality agreement and a custody agreement. In Procedural Order No. 2 [
 <a href="http://icsidfiles.worldbank.org/icsid/ICSIDBLOBS/OnlineAwards/C4706/DC10600_En.pdf">

 </a>
 ], the tribunal thus ordered the parties to maintain their best efforts to complete the declassification process, and confirmed that Romania should have equal access to the declassified documents during the proceedings.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Claimants ask for “emergency temporary provisional measures,” citing risks of insolvency following tax and antifraud investigations by Romanian authorities
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 As Romania was responding to the claimants’ first request for provisional measures, the tribunal received a second request for provisional measures, and a related request for “emergency temporary provisional measures” pending the resolution of this second request (dated July 28, 2016).
</p>
<p>
 This new request concerned two investigations concerning RMGC, launched and pursued by agencies of Romania’s Ministry of Finance, which represents Romania in the arbitral proceedings. One investigation is pursued by the Antifraud Directorate; the other by the Tax Directorate, and resulted in a Value Added Tax (VAT) assessment that claimed $6.7 million of VAT liability from RMGC.
</p>
<p>
 The claimants argued that both investigations were in retaliation for the filing of this arbitration and, citing the need to ensure the procedural integrity of the ICSID case, sought measures to prevent Romania from aggravating the dispute or from benefitting from the documents and information obtained as the result of these investigations.
</p>
<p>
 Notably, the claimants underlined that the enforcement of the VAT liability threatened to push RMGC into insolvency, a development which would definitely deprive them of their investment and prevent further access to the project company’s books and records.
</p>
<p>
 To postpone such enforcement and challenge the tax investigation before Romanian courts, the claimants would have to post a guarantee long before any decision could be taken by the arbitral tribunal on these questions. (Readers may recall that Gabriel Resources is a sole-asset company, whose arbitration has been funded against a share of the eventual compensation, if any is awarded by the tribunal.) Accordingly, the claimants sought emergency temporary provisional measures to preserve the status quo while the tribunal examined this second request.*
</p>

 <strong>
  Tribunal confirms power to grant emergency measures but sees no basis for it in this case
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 While the tribunal denied the respondent’s request for emergency temporary provisional measures in a brief letter dated August 19, 2016, its reasoning was later detailed in an October 21, 2016 reasoned decision communicated to the parties [
 <a href="http://icsidfiles.worldbank.org/icsid/ICSIDBLOBS/OnlineAwards/C4706/DC10604_En.pdf">

 </a>
 ].
</p>
<p>
 In this decision, the tribunal explained that it has the power to grant such emergency measures; however, it found that the requirements to do so were not met in this case.
</p>
<p>
 In particular, the tribunal noted the insufficient evidence available to assess the motivations behind the investigations, or their compliance with Romanian law. The tribunal also deemed the claimants to be capable of posting the guarantee demanded under Romanian law, without suffering “irreparable harm.”
</p>
<p>
 The tribunal also added that, “as a matter of discretion,” Romania’s prejudice would be greater were the emergency measures granted, notably because such measures would hamper the “right of the State to enforce its domestic laws.”
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Tribunal has jurisdiction to order second set of provisional measures as tax carve-out in the BIT does not apply…
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Having already ruled on the emergency request, the tribunal subsequently decided the claimants’ second request for provisional measures in a November 22, 2016 decision [
 <a href="http://icsidfiles.worldbank.org/icsid/ICSIDBLOBS/OnlineAwards/C4706/DC10597_En.pdf">

 </a>
 ].
</p>
<p>
 As it turned out, Romania’s administrative courts had earlier quashed the contested VAT assessment, prompting Gabriel Resources to drop that part of its provisional measures request. Accordingly, the November 22, 2016 decision addressed only the claimants’ request with respect to the documents and information gathered by the Romanian authorities during the tax and anti-fraud investigations. (The claimants expressed concern that these documents might be used against them in the ICSID arbitration.)
</p>
<p>
 Romania argued that the tribunal had no jurisdiction to accede to this request, given the carve-out for tax measures included in the Canada-Romania BIT. While Gabriel Resources sought to rely on the absence of such a carve-out in the Romania-UK BIT, Romania cited the precedent of EuroGas v Slovakia, also arbitrated under two BITs (see
 <a href="pick%20and%20choose%20between%20what%20they%20consider%20to%20be%20the%20more%20favorable%20provisions">
  here
 </a>
 ), for the proposition that a party cannot “pick and choose between what they consider to be the more favorable provisions under the two BITs.”
</p>
<p>
 The tribunal, however, rejected Romania’s reading of the EuroGas developments, and suggested instead that the way to deal with two divergent BITs requires a case-by-case assessment. The tribunal explained that the consolidation of the two BIT claims in the Gabriel Resources v. Romania case “does not amount to a re-writing, substituting or setting aside of the legal entitlements of the parties under the UK – Romania BIT” and that it is not true that the “more stringent or narrower provision in two incompatible BITs should always prevail.”
</p>
<p>
 In any case, and on the merits, the tribunal was not satisfied that the carve-out applied in this case, as the claimants were not asking to put an end to the antifraud or tax investigations, but merely seeking to protect the integrity of the arbitration with respect to the documents and evidence collected during these investigations.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  … but requirements for provisional measures are not met in this case
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Yet, the tribunal ultimately dismissed the claimants’ request. In support of this decision, the tribunal accepted Romania’s argument that Romanian law already provided for confidentiality of the documents and information collected during the investigations. There was no evidence of a material risk that these laws have been or would be breached by Romania, the tribunal observed.
</p>
<p>
 Whereas the arbitrators appreciated the concerns of the claimants in view of the relation between the timing of the arbitration and that of the investigation, “it would not be safe to draw an inference based purely on this fact alone.” The tribunal did not find any evidence of abusive or retaliatory conduct in the handling of the investigations either. As a result, it dismissed the claimants’ request in its entirety.
</p>
<p>
 The tribunal once again reserved costs for a later phase.
