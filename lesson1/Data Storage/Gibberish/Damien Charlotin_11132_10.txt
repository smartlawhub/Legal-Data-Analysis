The tribunal properly declined to reopen the case on the basis of “new evidence”   Lastly, the decision on annulment also revealed that Argentina, in a rare move, requested the tribunal to reopen the case under article 38(2) of the Arbitration Rules. Argentina’s request followed a decision from the Argentine bankruptcy court that ruled on the amounts owed by the now-defunct OSM to its creditors. In Argentina’s contention, this decision was “new evidence” in the meaning of article 38(2), which required a new assessment of the damages owed by Argentina.  In the still unpublished 2014 decision on reopening, the tribunal refused to grant this request, and held that these sums were in any event irrelevant for the damages’ assessment, insofar the ICSID and bankruptcy proceedings were totally distinct and had different purposes. The committee, in its turn, held that this reasoning was clear enough and that it properly dealt with Argentina’s request.  Following what it accepted as a practice of leaving the costs of annulment proceedings to the parties, notwithstanding the results of the annulment, the ad-hoc committee ordered Argentina to pay the administrative costs and arbitrators’ fees.
