No serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure   Having failed to find fault with the award’s reasoning on jurisdiction (and, indeed, stressing the relevance of the Lanco precedent), the committee proceeded to examine the grounds of annulment with respect to the tribunal’s merits reasoning.  As a first ground, the claimants alleged that the tribunal had disregarded a fundamental rule of procedure in dismissing their claims based on article 16(4), although such legal question had never been “adequately canvassed in argument.”  The committee however stressed that the term “rule of procedure” related to “the manner in which the Tribunal proceeded,” rather than to the award’s content. Further, the committee suggested that it was not “unprecedented in judicial decision-making” that the reasoning of adjudicators, in reconciling the various elements of a case, might come as a surprise to some parties (as long as it is not ultra petita ). An alleged breach of a fundamental rule of procedure had nothing to do with this, especially when the parties had had “full and fair opportunity” to be heard – as they had in this case, where the tribunal, in particular, requested post-hearing briefs in relation to the issue (the interplay of the forum selection clause with the claims) that eventually proved central to the case.
