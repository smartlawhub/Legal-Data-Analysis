Legitimate expectations must be respected, even when actions of judiciary are at issue   Ukraine’s conduct also seems to have breached Tatneft’s legitimate expectations of a predictable, consistent and stable legal framework. Although the tribunal did not flatly declare such a finding, it instead rejected an argument by Ukraine that respect for legitimate expectations arises only in relation to executive acts. The tribunal disagreed that the acts of the judiciary are controlled only by the denial of justice standard: a “predictable, consistent and stable legal framework is a FET requirement which ought to be safeguarded in its integrity irrespective of which organ of the State might compromise its availability.”
