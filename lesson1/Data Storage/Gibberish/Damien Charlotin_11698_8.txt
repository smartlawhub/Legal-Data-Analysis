Tecmed’s definition of FET strongly influenced later jurisprudence   The tribunal’s definition of FET became a cornerstone of future investors’ claims under the FET standard, and was endorsed by many later tribunals and arbitrators (such as Henri Alvarez’s separate opinion in Total v. Argentina, discussed here ). The Tecmed tribunal’s emphasis on transparency was followed by tribunals such as in Gold Reserve v. Venezuela and Micula v. Romania (even if reliance on this concept had already led to annulment of the award in Metalclad v. Mexico, reviewed here ).  Meanwhile, Tecmed’s support for a stable and predictable legal framework was picked up in some later awards (e.g. Murphy v. Ecuador and Binder v. Czech Republic ), but toned down in favour of “regulatory flexibility” in others (e.g. Charanne v. Spain ).  But Tecmed’s “extreme” interpretations worried other tribunals, including in the Cargill v. Mexico case (discussed here ) and perhaps most notably, as we reported , the tribunal in El Paso v. Argentina remarked that Tecmed’s analysis of FET established “a programme of good governance that no State in the world is capable of guaranteeing at all times”.  Nevertheless, the most important holding from Tecmed was certainly the concept of legitimate expectations, which took centre stage in dozens of future cases. It is now commonplace for tribunals (see e.g. Electrabel v. Hungary ) to affirm that legitimate expectations form the principal element of the FET standard. Still, this concept has been severely criticized by some respondents and individual arbitrators (e.g. Pedro Nikken’s separate opinion in Suez v. Argentina, analyzed here ). Moreover, later tribunals have sometimes sought to narrow the scope of expectations to specific commitments only (e.g. in EDF v. Romania ), or to curtail their relevance at all (particularly in cases under treaties tying the FET standard to customary international law, such as Mesa v. Canada ).
