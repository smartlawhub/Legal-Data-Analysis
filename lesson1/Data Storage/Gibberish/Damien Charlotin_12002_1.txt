In a rare move, after arbitrators decline jurisdiction over dispute, investor’s home state courts rule that they will adjudicate claims for breach of bilateral investment treaty    In a rare instance of a claim for breach of a bilateral investment treaty being litigated in a domestic court, the Spanish courts appear set to hear a case brought by an aggrieved Spanish investor against Equatorial Guinea.  Recently, a Madrid appeal court overturned the findings of a lower judge who held that the Spanish construction company Grupo Francisco Hernando Contreras SL (GFHC) could not submit its dispute with Equatorial Guinea to the Spanish courts (judgment available here , in Spanish).  The court found that the Equatorial Guinea-Spain Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) was applicable to the case, including with respect to unrealized investments (the treaty also mentions “promotion” of investments).  The court also ruled that Spanish courts have jurisdiction over the case, even though the various jurisdictional options listed in the BIT do not explicitly provide for settlement by the courts of the investor’s home state. For the Madrid court, the BIT merely offers a non-exhaustive list of options to the investor, and in any case, now that an ICSID arbitration has been dismissed on jurisdictional grounds (see further below), GFHC should be free to try its luck with domestic courts (raising some question as to whether the investor is being afforded ‘two bites at the apple’ in its bid to sue Equatorial Guinea).  Since the Spanish courts have not yet grappled with the merits of the case, we will report in more detail on those developments as they unfold. Meanwhile, we analyze the earlier ICSID award in more detail below. ( We had reported only briefly on the underlying dispute and the arbitral award when we obtained a copy of the latter last year).
