Relevant date is the publication of nationalisation decree   While the BITs provided for compensation to be equivalent to the market value of the assets on the day prior to the moment the expropriation was made public, the parties disagreed as to what date should be chosen. The investors pointed to the first Nationalisation Decree, in 2008, which heralded the imminent nationalization of the steel and iron industry.  Venezuela, on the contrary, argued for May 20, 2009, when then President Chavez announced explicitly that Tavsa and Comsigua would be expropriated. Venezuela noted that Tenaris, in a filing with the American SEC, used this date in disclosing the devaluation of its investment in Tavsa. As for Comsigua, Venezuela stressed that the entity was not listed in the Nationalisation Decree, while most other expropriated companies were.  The tribunal sided with the investors in holding that the SEC filing was irrelevant, and attributable to accounting considerations. Arbitrators also noted that Comsigua implicitly fell within the scope of the Nationalisation decree, given that it was part of the iron and steel industry and the affiliate of another named entity. As a result, the relevant date for valuation purposes was April 30, 2008.
