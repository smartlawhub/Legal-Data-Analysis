Claimants prove they hold an investment despite “complex” ownership structure   Second, the respondent mounted a multifaceted challenge to the status of the claimants as “investors” holding an “investment” in Uzbekistan.  In a first step, the discussion centred on the structure of the companies and holdings through which the claimants owned their shares in BC and KC. The tribunal agreed that this structure was “complex”. It changed over time, and involved several intermediary entities in the British Virgin Islands and Cyprus.  Uzbekistan contended that the claimants failed to prove both their continuous ownership of the investment and the reality of the ownership structure at the time of the treaty breach.  These objections failed on the facts, as the tribunal stressed that what mattered was the claimants’ ownership at the time of the breach. Any break in this ownership during the investment’s life was irrelevant for jurisdictional purposes.  Here, although there was a temporal gap in the claimants’ account of its ownership, the tribunal was satisfied of the claimants’ stake in the ownership structure at the time of the breach.
