ANALYSIS: In Yemen decision, tribunal situates its reasoning on narrow jurisdictional clause within context of other prior cases under Chinese and Russian treaties     As we reported in a brief article, arbitrators recently ruled on the jurisdictional objections raised by Yemen in its dispute with Chinese claimant Beijing Urban Construction Group Co. Ltd (BUCG). Below, we report more fully on the May 31, 2017 decision on jurisdiction [ click to download ].  The dispute, heard by a tribunal of Arbitrator 
   (chair, appointed by the parties), Arbitrator 
   (claimant’s appointee), and Arbitrator 
   (Yemen’s appointee), has its roots in a 2006 contract to build a $100 million international terminal for Yemen’s main airport, in Sana’a. Following the termination of the contract in July 2009, the claimant filed for arbitration with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) in November 2014 (see here ). Hearings on jurisdiction were held in March 2017.  The proceedings are held under the 2002 China-Yemen Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT), which, as described below, limits the jurisdiction of investor-state tribunals. While the tribunal dismissed Yemen’s objections regarding the scope of its jurisdiction, it also rejected the claimant’s attempts to broaden it by way of the BIT’s Most-Favoured Nation (MFN) clause.
