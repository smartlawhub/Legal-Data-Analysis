Waiver obligation bars simultaneous pursuit of local proceedings targeting the same measures – even if NAFTA breaches are not asserted locally   In this case, the tribunal deemed that Waste Management had failed to materially comply with its own waiver. Contrary to the claimant’s view, Article 1121 sought to prevent duplicative proceedings, meaning that the local proceedings targeting the same measures were still problematic even if they did not assert a breach of NAFTA.  Since Waste Management chose to continue the Mexican proceedings after submitting its waiver, it was deemed defective. No later action from the claimant could cure this defect. The tribunal therefore held that it lacked jurisdiction, and it ordered the claimant to pay the arbitration’s costs (although Mexico was left to bear its own defence costs).
