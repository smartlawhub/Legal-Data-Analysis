Santiago court’s 2008 judgment at the basis of the new claim   The new claim appears to seize upon a local court judgment in Chile that arose shortly after the 2008 merits award in the ICSID case.  In July 2008, shortly after the ICSID tribunal concluded that the alleged expropriation was beyond the BIT’s temporal scope, a Santiago civil court judgment finally answered Mr Pey Casado’s efforts to recover one physical asset: a Goss printing press seized during the coup d’état. (While the 2008 ICSID award deemed the expropriation claim to be outside its jurisdiction, arbitrators had found that delays in resolving this Chilean case constituted a denial of justice).  The claimant’s shares in CPP, and the assets of the company, had been taken by the Chilean government through a 1975 decree signed by the Pinochet government. According to the claimants, the Santiago court in the 2008 judgment found the 1975 decree to be void. (However, as we have noted , the 2016 award recorded the arbitrators’ doubt as to the claimants’ interpretation of this local judgment.)  Notably, the Santiago court also found that the five-year limitations period under Chilean law applied from 1975 and that, therefore, Mr Pey Casado could not succeed in a claim for recovery. In the newly-filed RFA, the claimants challenge the Santiago court’s findings in this respect, stressing that Mr Pey Casado had to enter into exile following the coup d’état, and could not bring his domestic court claim until democracy had been restored in Chile.  The claimants also allege that later wrongful actions by Chile hobbled the Chilean proceedings; in particular, Chilean officials allegedly prevented the judgment from being sent to Mr Pey Casado personally. Mr Pey Casado became aware of the 2008 judgment only in January 2010,*** after Chile had already successfully moved for the local case to be deemed to have been “abandoned” and thus discontinued..
