No expropriation where returns are actually higher than planned   On the merits, the tribunal found that the returns of the claimant’s solar plants, under the new system, surpassed those it expected to see at the time of the investment. As such, there was no substantial decrease in the investment’s value, and no expropriation.  To come to this finding, the tribunal preferred to disregard the claimant’s expert reports submitted by Deloitte for the arbitration, which relied on a DCF method, and relied instead on the valuation methods found in an earlier (2011) Deloitte report (see above).  For the tribunal, this 2011 report, which sought to compute the impacts of the Spanish 2010 measures on the solar plants’ profitability, was particularly relevant for the present proceedings. Using this report’s method, and taking into account the legal and regulatory developments since 2011, Spain’s experts came to an even higher rate of return of 7.1%.  Judging that the claimant failed to convincingly challenge this methodology, the tribunal dismissed the indirect expropriation claim.
