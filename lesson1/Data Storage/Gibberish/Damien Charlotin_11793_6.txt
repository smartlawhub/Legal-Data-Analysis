Canada is denied attorney fees but can enforce award in the US   Although Canada was successful on the merits, the DC Court dismissed its request for attorney fees. The Court reasoned that petitioning for a set aside is part of a losing party’s rights in an arbitration. Although Mesa Power’s arguments failed, they were not frivolous nor indicative of bad faith, and thus did not warrant reimbursement of Canada’s fees.  However, the District Court also granted Canada’s counter-petition to confirm and enforce the award in the United States. This will allow Canada to collect the third of its legal fees (from the underlying arbitration) that the tribunal had ordered the claimant to pay.
