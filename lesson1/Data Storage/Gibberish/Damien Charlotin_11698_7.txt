Tribunal adopts extensive – and controversial – interpretation of FET   Despite the expropriation finding, the tribunal also reviewed the investor’s further claims, notably including its FET claim.  Albeit without particular analysis or reasoning, the tribunal introduced this section by describing the content of the FET standard. In its view, the standard included “treatment that does not affect the basic expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor to make the investment”, as well as “consistent” conduct “free from ambiguity and totally transparent”.  The tribunal was however ambiguous as to what these “basic expectations” were. Earlier in the award, it examined the contractual documentation associated with Tecmed’s acquisition of the landfill, and concluded that the continued legal permission to operate the landfill was among the “legitimate expectations” of the investor when it made the investment. Elsewhere, the tribunal referred to the investor’s expectations that INE would consider only ecological (not socio-political) grounds in renewing the permit, and to Tecmed’s expectations that its permit would be renewed pending relocation of the landfill.  (In more recent awards, as explained below, the exact nature of the legitimate expectations allegedly violated has been a central part of tribunals’ analysis of the FET standard).  Notwithstanding, the tribunal had no difficulty finding that Tecmed’s legitimate expectations had been frustrated by the respondent. The tribunal stressed that INE never offered an “explicit, transparent and clear” warning that the permit might be refused prior to the expected relocation, or even “clear signs” that would have allowed the investor “to adopt a behavior to prevent the non-renewal of the Permit”.  Such lack of transparency, accompanied by contradictions and ambiguities in INE’s conduct, hindered the investor’s “planning of its business activity”, and were thus held to violate FET.
