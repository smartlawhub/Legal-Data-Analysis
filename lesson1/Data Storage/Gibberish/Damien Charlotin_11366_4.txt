Tribunal confirms power to grant emergency measures but sees no basis for it in this case   While the tribunal denied the respondent’s request for emergency temporary provisional measures in a brief letter dated August 19, 2016, its reasoning was later detailed in an October 21, 2016 reasoned decision communicated to the parties [ click to download ].  In this decision, the tribunal explained that it has the power to grant such emergency measures; however, it found that the requirements to do so were not met in this case.  In particular, the tribunal noted the insufficient evidence available to assess the motivations behind the investigations, or their compliance with Romanian law. The tribunal also deemed the claimants to be capable of posting the guarantee demanded under Romanian law, without suffering “irreparable harm.”  The tribunal also added that, “as a matter of discretion,” Romania’s prejudice would be greater were the emergency measures granted, notably because such measures would hamper the “right of the State to enforce its domestic laws.”
