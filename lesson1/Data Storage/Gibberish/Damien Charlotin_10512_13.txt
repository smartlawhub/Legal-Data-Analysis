Wrongful arrest of a manager is also grounds for some compensation to claimant   The tribunal also awarded $50,000 to compensate for the arrest of one manager of Balkan Energy: the manager had been arrested and imprisoned without access to a lawyer for two days, shortly after Balkan Energy instituted the arbitration. Ghana insisted that the manager had no standing to bring this claim. However, on the tribunal’s view, such an arrest was not only a harm to the manager, but also an undue “interference with the ordinary conduct of the business of the Claimant” that warranted compensation.
