Unpaid oil deliveries could be consequential damages arising from Ukraine’s breaches   Ukraine’s second admissibility objection concerned Tatneft’s claim for unpaid oil deliveries. In Ukraine’s view, this was a contractual matter, to which Ukraine was not privy, and which could not be resolved by the tribunal.  Unpersuaded, the tribunal accepted Tatneft’s contention that its claims concerned consequential damages, and were moreover linked to a whole set of facts surrounding the Kremenchug refinery and Ukraine’s treaty breaches. As such, this claim could be resolved only at the merits stage. ( As we reported , this particular claim failed ultimately due to lack of causality.)
