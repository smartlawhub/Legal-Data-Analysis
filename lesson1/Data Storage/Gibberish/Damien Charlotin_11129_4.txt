Suspect judicial actions buttress effort by Privat Group to seize control   On much of the above facts, the parties broadly agreed. The question before the tribunal was whether these events amounted to a “corporate raid” on their investment as argued by the claimant – and whether this raid had been (wrongfully) facilitated by Ukraine.  On the subject of Mr Ovcharenko’s dismissal, the tribunal was untroubled by the 2004 events, given that the local court’s judgment to reinstate Mr Ovcharenko was formally complied with – if only for one day.  More troubling in the view of the tribunal were the 2007 ex parte decisions, which did not appear to be in compliance with Ukrainian procedural law. The fact that “the interim measures were issued thirty minutes earlier than the Supplementary Judgment they were supposed to enforce, d[id] not help to explain a logical legal sequence of these acts, which is normally the other way around.”  Nor did the enforcement of the decisions properly obey the requirements of Ukrainian procedure. The evidence led the tribunal to find that the respondent’s narrative – of a peaceful, voluntary reinstatement of Mr Ovcharenko – was dubious.  Similarly, the tribunal was unconvinced by Ukraine’s argument that Mr Ovcharenko’s subsequent decisions were solely managerial. Multiple decisions attested to Mr Ovcharenko’s effective take-over of the company and harm to the other shareholders’ rights, including banning the former Chairman, who remained a board member, from the refinery, or ceasing to send financial reports to the shareholders  Lastly, the tribunal could not “fail to notice” that the criminal investigations into the take-over were discontinued in spite of sufficiently serious acts that warranted further inquiry.
