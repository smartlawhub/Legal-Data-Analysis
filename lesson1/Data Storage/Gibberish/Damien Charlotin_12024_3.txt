Although it prevailed, Venezuela is not awarded its legal costs   Despite Venezuela’s success in dismissing the claims, the tribunal refused to order the claimants to bear Venezuela’s legal costs, referring to the several (unsuccessful) challenges brought by the state against Mr Fortier (we reported on the fourth of these challenges here ), as well as to Venezuela’s refusal to pay its advance on costs during the proceedings. The tribunal however ordered the claimants to shoulder the costs of the arbitration.  For our full analysis of the award, click here.
