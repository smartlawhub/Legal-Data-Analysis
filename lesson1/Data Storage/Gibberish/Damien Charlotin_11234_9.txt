Effective means obligation can be imported from Energy Charter Treaty, but is seemingly not relevant   Another claim under the “effective means” standard (imported via MFN from article 10(12) of the Energy Charter Treaty) was also discussed briefly at two junctures. At one point, the tribunal found that there was no breach “as [Ukraine’s] court system had been generally available.” However, the award also records the arbitrators’ view that this question was “inseparable” from questions under the FET standard.  Similarly, at a later juncture, the award is somewhat ambiguous as to whether the tribunal sidestepped this issue because the same measures had already given rise to a breach of FET, or because the effective means obligation itself was viewed as subsumed into the FET obligation.  (The relevant provision of the award reads as follows: “The Tribunal has discussed above the factual and legal questions concerning both denial of justice and the availability of effective means for the assertion of claims and enforcement of rights. As liability has already been found in the light of the fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security standards, there is no need to examine the question of effective means separately, which is to a large extent subsumed under that standard.”)
