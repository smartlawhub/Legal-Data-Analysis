The type of expropriation was irrelevant for Argentina’s defense   Argentina also took issue with how the tribunal dealt with the claim for expropriation, alleging that the pleadings concentrated exclusively on the existence of an indirect expropriation, while the tribunal eventually held that a direct expropriation took place. In Argentina’s view, this surprising finding proved to be not only beyond the scope of the proceedings, but also a fundamental breach of procedure, as its right to be heard on this issue has been infringed.  On this point as well, the committee was unmoved. It stressed these contentions’ artificiality: irrespective of the qualification of the expropriation as direct or indirect, SAUR claimed that it had been illegally dispossessed of its investment in OSM, and Argentina answered that claim. The debate centered on the article of the treaty prohibiting expropriations, and Argentina had plenty of opportunity to argue its case on this point, and no breach of procedure thus occurred. In these circumstances the tribunal was free to adopt the qualification “direct expropriation”, and this choice was beyond the committee’s scope of review, especially given that the underlying decision was clearly and sufficiently reasoned.
