Dissenter would not have dismissed first arbitration   In dissent, arbitrator Keith Highet took issue (in particular) with the tribunal’s main premise that it was entitled to assess the investor’s compliance with the waiver. In his view, in providing for formal submission of the waiver, article 1121 merely offers respondents a tool they are free to use in parallel proceedings they wish to stop; assessing the claimant’s compliance with a waiver would deprive the waiver’s formal requirements of purpose (since it would be enough to just mandatorily bar claimants from pursuing other remedies). Besides, and contrary to what the majority considered, the waiver related to the admissibility of the claim and not to the tribunal’s jurisdiction.  Despite this dissent, subsequent tribunals have tended to follow the majority’s reasoning – finding that a claimant’s failure to comply with the waiver requirement could deny a tribunal jurisdiction over a claim – even if only partially (see, e.g., our discussion of RDC v. Guatemala ). As we reported last July , Peru successfully raised a similar objection in its dispute against investor Renco. Like Waste Management, Renco immediately undertook to resubmit its claim to a second tribunal.
