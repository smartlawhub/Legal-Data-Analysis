“Corporate planning” is not necessarily an abuse of process   Spain had a further point to make regarding this restructuring: that it was constitutive of an abuse of process, an instance of “forum shopping” where the investor chose to allow a protected entity to litigate internationally an already-existing dispute. (Readers will recall that a similar objection succeeded in earlier cases, and most notably in Philip Morris v Australia .)  Spain stressed that, although the impugned measures – starting with a decree dated December 2012 – were enacted only after ISOLUX’s decision to relocate its assets with Isolux BV, the reform of the Spanish energy regulatory regime had been mooted long before.  However, the tribunal turned this argument on its head, and noted that it would not be “strange” for PSP, in view of the prevailing regulatory uncertainty, to insist that its stake in the Spanish solar sector be invested through a Dutch entity that would be protected under the ECT. For the tribunal, “this would be no more than a case of ‘legitimate corporate planning’,” and it is doubtful that PSP would have been ready to invest absent such option.  The tribunal noted that such corporate planning would amount to an abuse of process only with respect to pre-existing disputes. Given that the impugned measures were enacted only after the corporate changes, there was no abuse to be found.
