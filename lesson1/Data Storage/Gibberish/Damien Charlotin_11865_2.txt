Italy suspects existence of litigation funding and seeks security for costs   Italy’s suspicions that Eskosol was receiving litigation funding arose after realising that the claimant had failed to put into the ICSID record part of the Italian bankruptcy court’s resolution authorising the receiver to start the ICSID arbitration. The omitted passages of the resolution suggested that the arbitration would not be a financial burden for Eskosol. The claimant later confirmed the existence of a third-party funding arrangement.  Italy thus asked the tribunal to order Eskosol to post funds – around €250,000 – that would serve as security for costs, were Eskosol’s claims to fail. Italy relied on the case of RSM v Saint Lucia , to this day the only known investment arbitration case in which a tribunal has acceded to such a request. In Italy’s view, Eskosol’s bankruptcy, as well as its reliance on litigation funding, indicated that the risks of non-compliance with an adverse award on costs were “material and serious.”  Alternatively, Italy asked the tribunal to direct Eskosol to obtain a binding commitment from the funder that any adverse costs order would be paid.
