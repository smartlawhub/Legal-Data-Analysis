Subsidiary request for bank guarantee is rejected   Alternatively, the investors had asked the Committee to order Bolivia to post a bank guarantee (or any other form of security) in the amount of the award. The claimants cited the decision of the ad hoc committee in Sempra v Argentina (of which Mr Christer Söderlund was also member), which had granted a similar request in view of Argentina’s history of uneven compliance (see here ).  This latter request was characterized by Bolivia as beyond the reach of the committee’s powers, as it amounted to a request for provisional measures – something that article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention arguably did not cover. Bolivia relied on the decision of the ad hoc committee in Libananco Holding v Cyprus (of which Mr Rigo Sureda was also a member), which had expressed doubts regarding the existence of such powers (see our analysis here ).  However, the committee noted that the Libananco committee – whatever its doubts – had declined to make a finding on this question, as the investor in that case had failed to prove its case anyway. Moreover, citing the analysis by the ad hoc committee in Enron v Argentina (see here ), the committee found that it enjoyed such a power.  Yet, on the facts, the committee found that Bolivia’s pledge to honour the award was expressed in words usually found satisfactory by other committees. Thus the committee declined the claimant’s subsidiary request.  The committee reserved its decision on costs until its future decision on the annulment.  Bolivia is represented in these annulment proceedings by Dechert LLP; claimants are assisted by counsels from Chilean law firm Bofill Mir &amp; Alvarez Jana Abogados.
