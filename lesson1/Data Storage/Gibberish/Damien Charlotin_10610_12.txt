Domestic referral procedure for tax is compulsory, and complied with, if only belatedly   Notwithstanding the carve-out, the tribunal observed that the claimant had the possibility under article 21(5) ECT to debate the expropriatory effect of the carved-out taxation measures, provided the investor refers the question to the competent Spanish authorities first. As we reported , the Eiser tribunal found that the claimant in that case had failed to comply with this requirement.  In the present case, Isolux had maintained from the outset that this referral procedure was not compulsory, nor was there a mechanism in Spain to which to refer such question.  However, the claimant eventually submitted the question to the Spanish authorities in 2016, and informed the tribunal that it had received an answer just as the tribunal closed the proceedings. This rendered the question moot.  The tribunal nonetheless confirmed that the requirement was compulsory under the ECT (as indicated by the use of the future tense in article 21(5)), although a failure to comply would not automatically entail the inadmissibility of the claims.  As we report in our companion article , the claimant’s behaviour in relation to this question had an impact on the tribunal’s assessment on costs.
