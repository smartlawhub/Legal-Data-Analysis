Costs reserved, but Argentina’s objections were inappropriate   While the tribunal reserved the costs of the jurisdictional phase for the end of the proceedings (see below), it noted that most of Argentina’s objections had been either raised unsuccessfully at earlier stages, or in many other fora before (an Appendix to the award lists all 18 cases against Argentina which found that derivative and shareholder claims were permitted under international law). As a result, the tribunal concluded that Argentina’s objections had been not only unfounded, but also raised “inappropriately”.
