Claimants allege that first investor dispute not a bar to the new one   The connection between the ICSID claims and the new request for arbitration being apparent, the RFA also expounds on what allegedly distinguishes this new claim from the previous one. Such explanation seems important given the res judicata effects of the 2008 and the 2016 ICSID awards, but also in view of article 26 of the ICSID Convention which provides that consent “of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy.”  According to the claimants, the 2016 award did not rule on the consequences of the 2008 judgment from the Santiago Court, nor on Chile’s allegedly wrongful actions that followed this judgment.  Moreover, the request for arbitration emphasizes the 2016 award’s finding that the conclusions of the tribunal did “not touch the finding in the First Award that the Respondent had committed a breach of Article 4 of the BIT by failing to guarantee fair and equitable treatment to the Claimants’ investments, including a denial of justice; that finding is res judicata and was not part of the present resubmission proceedings. It thus represents a subsisting obligation on the Respondent and one which, as the First Tribunal found, arose out of a failure in the operation of the Chilean internal system for the redress of acknowledged past injustices.”
