Tribunal sees objective meaning of investment, but deems that acquired investments are protected under the ECT   Spain further denied that Isolux had made an investment in Spain, given that it came into possession of its Spanish assets (a majority participation in the Spanish domestic firm T-solar, which itself owned several solar power plants) only as the result of a corporate restructuring that saw the Spanish conglomerate ISOLUX welcome the Canadian PSP as a co-investor. In the process, ISOLUX’s Spanish assets were transferred to the claimant, while PSP acquired some of its shares. For the respondent, this was not an investment under the ECT.  Spain interpreted the term “investment” according to an objective meaning as developed by investment jurisprudence. The tribunal agreed with this position, in the event rejecting the investor’s contention that the ECT’s definition was “self-sufficient.” Indeed, the tribunal noted that most investment treaties, the ECT included, were relatively silent as to what an investment is, supporting the need for an objective definition. This meant the one progressively elaborated in past jurisprudence.  On this point Spain’s arguments were unsuccessful, as the tribunal accepted that Isolux had an investment under the ECT. Spain did not contest that ISOLUX had had an investment in the Spanish power plants, but contested the transfer of assets to the claimant. Yet, as the tribunal noted, the ECT itself defines “make investments” so as to include “acquiring all or part of existing Investments.” This is exactly what Isolux BV did here, which meant that the tribunal had jurisdiction ratione materiae .
