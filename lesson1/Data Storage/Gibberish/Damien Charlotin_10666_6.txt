The committee members began by establishing their own powers to decide on Argentina’s disqualification proposal – an issue of first impression, given the silence of the ICSID Convention on challenges in annulment proceedings. While the Convention itself does not explicitly extend the provisions regarding challenge to annulment proceedings, the Arbitration Rules do. The members found that the inclusion of such provision in the Arbitration Rules (despite the Convention’s silence) was proper, notably since it was concordant with the object and purpose of the Convention that the committee appeared to be “independent and impartial.”  Argentina took issue with Mr Fortier’s disclosure that one of the partners in his (then) law firm, Ogilvy Renault, was advising CGE in relation to Québec’s tax law. In reply, Mr Fortier explained that he was not involved in this work, of which only a minor amount would remain outstanding while the committee would be sitting.  The committee members were satisfied that these facts did not suffice to sustain Argentina’s challenge to Mr Fortier: “the mere existence of some professional relationship with a party is not an automatic basis for disqualification of an arbitrator or Committee member.” (This was only the first of many challenges brought against Yves Fortier, often on account of his professional relationships; for the most recent one, see our report in Owens-Illinois v Venezuela .)
