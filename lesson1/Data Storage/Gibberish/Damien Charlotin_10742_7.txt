Abolition of original incentives was predictable   The claimant however claimed that it could not have predicted that the changes enacted by Spain would be so drastic. While previous changes had only amended the FiT regime, the measures at issue went further, abolishing the regime completley.  The tribunal disagreed, finding that the permanence of the special, original regime per se could not have been a legitimate expectation of the investor. At least as at October 2012, “all investors knew or should have known” that the special regime would be altered, and its abolition a realistic possibility.
