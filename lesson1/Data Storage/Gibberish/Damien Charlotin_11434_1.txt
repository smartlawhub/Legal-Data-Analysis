Analysis: In new decision in Blue Bank v. Venezuela case, arbitrators scrutinize effects of ICSID denunciation on claim against Venezuela     As we reported recently , a tribunal recently dismissed the claims of Barbados claimant Blue Bank International &amp; Trust (Barbados) Ltd. against Venezuela.  Blue Bank acted as trustee for a Barbados-based trust (the “Qatar Trust”), which indirectly owned a stake in two Venezuelan entities, ITC and Hemesa. These companies were granted concessions to rehabilitate and manage tourism and hospitality facilities in Venezuela and invested, according to the claimant, close to $100 million.
