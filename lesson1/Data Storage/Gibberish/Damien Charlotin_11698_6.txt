Tecmed’s views on proportionality, sole effects and police powers find resonances in later cases    As we’ve previously noted , in stressing the ideas of “due deference” and “proportionality”, the tribunal in Tecmed v. Mexico proved to be a source of inspiration to later tribunals that engaged in similar reviews of states’ regulatory powers (although not all applied such a strict proportionality standard).  Meanwhile, the Tecmed tribunal’s caution regarding the “sole effects” test found echoes among some later tribunals and commentators, wary of this test’s lack of concern for states’ regulatory powers. As we’ve reported , these criticisms have found their way into a new generation of BITs, with the 2012 US Model BIT, for instance, now downplaying the relevance of a merely adverse effect on an investor in establishing a treaty breach.  Further, despite the tribunal’s apparent rejection of a police powers exception (noted above), its ambivalence on the point may have served as a precursor to later developments, such as the Philip Morris v. Uruguay tribunal’s confirmation of “police powers” as an implicit carve-out from the treaty’s expropriation clause (see our coverage here ).
