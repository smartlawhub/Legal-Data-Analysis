Tribunal find that decisions of Ukraine courts were, on the whole, unfair and unreasonable   As the tribunal underlined when reviewing the facts, the troubling factor in this dispute was that each relevant event led “farther away from the faithful observance of the FET standard.”  These events included the reinstatement of Mr Ovcharenko as Chairman of Ukrtatnafta, including the ex parte orders obtained by Mr Ovcharenko (the tribunal acknowledged the findings of the tribunal in Deutsche Bank v. Sri Lanka , where similar, ex parte interim measures had been found to breach due process); the forceful take-over of the refinery; and the curious fate of the criminal investigations regarding these events (which had been quickly and suspiciously aborted despite their substantive basis).  For the tribunal, these events were disquieting in themselves, even if not necessarily giving rise on their own to a breach of the FET standard. However, these were deemed a mere prelude to more troubling behaviour, including questionable behaviour of the state Prosecutor,** and the multiple court proceedings through which Tatneft eventually lost its investment.  As a result, the debate over whether the Ukraine courts’ decisions themselves constituted a denial of justice was, in the tribunal’s mind, beside the point: these decisions, seen light of the entire set of circumstances, were unfair and unreasonable.
