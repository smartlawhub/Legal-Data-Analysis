Although Romania and the Commission are successful, investors may be granted security   This is not the first success for Romania and the Commission in resisting the enforcement of the award, as the judgment records that a garnishment order obtained on the award has been previously set aside in Belgium (an appeal is under way). Although the investors appear to be more successful in the US (see here ), the judgment reveals that these enforcement proceedings, and similar ones in France, Luxembourg, and Sweden, have so far failed to yield any result.  In a potential ray of light for the claimants****, Mr Justice Blair smiled on the claimants’ request for a security from Romania as a term of the stay – although a further hearing will be needed to determine such security’s legality under UK and EU law.  We will report on further developments in this case in due course.
