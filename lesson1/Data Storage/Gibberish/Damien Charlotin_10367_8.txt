Unusually-worded MFN clause still reaches into other treaty protections   Lastly, Ukraine objected that Tatneft failed to state an arguable, prima facie case under the BIT.  In Ukraine’s view, the rather unique “complete and unconditional legal protection” treaty standard on which the claimant relied could not be breached because the claimant had been able to enforce its legal protections before Ukrainian courts. Further, Ukraine stressed that the MFN clause on which the claimant sought to rely to import the fair and equitable treatment standard from the Ukraine-UK BIT (under which Tatneft’s claims would eventually succeed) referred to MFN for the “regime for the investments” and not MFN “treatment.” Ukraine argued that Tatneft was thus unable to import the fair and equitable treatment standard via this type of MFN clause.  However, the tribunal was satisfied that the claimant had made a prima facie claim, which was thus admissible. The interpretation of these two provisions was postponed to the merits.***
