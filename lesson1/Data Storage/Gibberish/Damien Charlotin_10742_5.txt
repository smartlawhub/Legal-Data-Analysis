Reasonable legitimate expectations are those of a prudent investor*   Turning to Isolux’s claim that the Spanish regulatory actions violated its legitimate expectations, the tribunal derived from the investment jurisprudence the idea that investors should be expected to have exercised due diligence before investing. While this does not mean that such due diligence be extensive and exhaustive, the alleged expectations of the investor should be measured against the information it should reasonably have known at the time of the investment.  In particular, the tribunal asserted, “an investor cannot hold legitimate expectations based on the regulatory framework when its personal information allows it to expect and anticipate the unfavourable evolution of this regulatory framework before it invests.”  The parties however differed as to what time this meant. Isolux pointed to the decision to invest, which was taken when its Spanish and Canadian parents decided to relocate the Spanish assets with the Dutch entity, in June 2012. For Spain, it meant the time such restructuring effectively took place, in October of that year. A majority of the tribunal concurred with Spain.
