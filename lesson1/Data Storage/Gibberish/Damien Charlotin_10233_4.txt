No breach of ICSID Convention in staying enforcement   The investors also argued that the UK’s obligations under the ICSID Convention prevailed over its obligations under EU law.  Thus, they contended that the High Court had a duty to enforce the award under the 1966 Act, which provides that ICSID awards are equivalent to judgments of the High Court. Indeed, the 1966 Act, in contrast with the Arbitration Act 1996 applicable to non-ICSID awards, offers no ground for courts to refuse to recognize or enforce the award. This was in keeping with the UK’s obligations under the ICSID Convention.  Mr Justice Blair agreed that, under the ICSID Convention, the UK had to treat ICSID awards as though they were final domestic judgments. However, he also found that this requirement went no further: once registered, an award is “not in a better (or worse) position” than such judgments. In particular, registration does not mean that the award should be automatically enforced: judgments are not.  Therefore, the stay was not a breach of the ICSID Convention because a “purely domestic judgment” would also have been stayed in similar circumstances.
