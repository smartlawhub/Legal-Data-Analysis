No need to suspend the arbitration in deference to Ghanaian courts   Ghana’s last attempt to prevent the tribunal from exercising jurisdiction relied on the order from the Ghana High Court and the doctrine of lis pendens . Citing the arbitral decision in the Mox Plant Case (in which arbitrator Mensah had been presiding over a five-member tribunal), Ghana argued that arbitral tribunals should defer to national and foreign courts seized of questions of arbitrability and suspend proceedings pending the determination of this question.  The tribunal was not convinced that the Mox Plant Case was relevant to this case, as the tribunal’s jurisdiction in the former case derived from a clause (article 282 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Seas) that excluded jurisdiction “if the parties in the dispute have agreed … that such dispute shall be submitted to another procedure that entails a binding decision”. Hence, arbitrators in the Mox case had reason to defer to the European Court of Justice, which had primary jurisdiction over disputes involving community law under the European treaties.  The Mox Plant Case was then sufficiently distinguishable. In the present case, the tribunal was “not only convinced that it has acted correctly in finding in favour of its jurisdiction in the arbitration, but […] also believe[d …] that it has an obligation to give effect to the commitment of the Parties to arbitration.” The order of the Ghanaian High Court – which, the tribunal noted, was “difficult to reconcile” with Ghana’s obligations under the New York Convention – had no bearing on this finding.
