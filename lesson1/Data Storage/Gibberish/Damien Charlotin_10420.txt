 International Court of Justice to have rare opportunity to weigh in on meaning of Fair and Equitable Treatment and other investment protections
</h1>
<p class="f-24">
</p>
<p>
 A new case before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) appears set to offer that judicial body a rare opportunity to interpret and apply certain legal protections more commonly seen in investor-state arbitration cases.
</p>
<p>
 On June 14, 2016, the Islamic Republic of Iran lodged a claim against the United States of America that shares some similarities with the investment disputes typically covered by

 – including a claim that the USA failed to grant Fair and Equitable Treatment to Iranian entities.
</p>
<p>
 It is likely that this case will be decided by the whole Court, which includes among its 15-strong bench judges who previously appeared in investment disputes, such as

  Dispute arises out of Executive Order that has made it easier for US claimants to collect damages from Iran
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Iran’s case arose out of recent legal developments in the United States, whereby some civil cases have been allowed to proceed to enforcement against certain Iranian assets (notably, the assets of Iran’s Central Bank, Bank Markazi).
</p>
<p>
 For some time now, the US has offered victims of terrorist acts legal ways to seek redress against foreign governments accused of supporting terrorism. While multiple cases have been filed against Iran, resulting in billions in awarded damages, the victims’ efforts to
 <em>
  collect
 </em>
 these damages have been complicated by immunities enjoyed by Iran and its instrumentalities. Although Iran and its instrumentalities had assets ripe for targeting in the US, most of these were shielded under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act – which provides additional protection for assets held by central banks.
</p>
<p>
 One case in particular stumbled due to these protections: that of Peterson et al. v Bank Markazi, where families of victims of the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing attempted to collect about $1.75 billion in damages from Bank Markazi.
</p>
<p>
 An Executive Order signed by President Obama in 2012 (Executive Order 13599) sought to improve the collectability of this and similar judgments by “blocking” all Iranian assets in the United States. Later, the US Congress passed the “Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act 2012” (the 2012 Act), which provides that frozen Iranian assets in the US shall be used to satisfy “any judgment to the extent of any compensatory damage against Iran”. The Act described these frozen assets as those identified in the Peterson et al. v Bank Markazi case.
</p>
<p>
 As the claimants in that case moved to seize these assets, Iran challenged the constitutionality of the relevant sections of the 2012 Act in US courts. After Iran lost before the Supreme Court on April 20, 2016 (opinion available
 <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-770_9o6b.pdf">

 ), the Iranian state filed its case before the International Court of Justice.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Iran finds jurisdiction in 1955 Treaty of Amity
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 According to Iran, the Court’s jurisdiction over this case lies in a Treaty of Amity, Economic Relations, and Consular Rights, signed by the two countries in 1955 and still in force today despite the severance of diplomatic ties between the US and Iran following the 1979 Revolution.
</p>
<p>
 The Treaty’s Article XXI(2) provides that “[a]ny dispute between the High Contracting Parties as to the interpretation or application of the present Treaty, not satisfactorily adjusted by diplomacy, shall be submitted to the International Court of Justice, unless the High Contracting Parties agree to settlement by some other pacific means.” (See
 <a href="http://www.parstimes.com/law/iran_us_treaty.html">
  here
 </a>
 for a copy of the treaty.)
</p>
<p>
 This is the third case put before the ICJ on the basis of this article, following the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran case (lodged by the US in 1979), and the Oil Platforms case (lodged by Iran in 1992). Nonetheless, it is probable that the US will contest the Court’s jurisdiction over this new case, as it unsuccessfully did in the Oil Platforms case.
</p>
<p>
 In a possible preview of arguments that the United States might raise in a jurisdictional opposition to this new ICJ proceeding, the US government has argued in an amicus brief before the US Supreme Court in the case of Peterson et al. v Bank Markazi that most of the Treaty’s provisions cited by Iran (see below) do not apply to government-held entities.*
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Iran’s claims are based on treaty provisions often found in investment treaties
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 In its application to the ICJ (and earlier before US courts), the Islamic Republic claims that the US’s conduct breached several articles of the Treaty of Amity. This includes notably the obligation for both parties to respect the juridical status of legal entities from the other party, an obligation allegedly disregarded by the US in equating Bank Markazi with Iran.
</p>
<p>
 Iran also cites the prohibition of restrictions on financial transfers, or the Treaty’s general provision that between the parties’ territories “there shall be freedom of commerce and navigation”. Further, Iran claims that in denying it immunity from jurisdiction and enforcement, the US violated the Treaty’s obligations to grant “nationals and companies of either” party “freedom of access to the court of justice” of the other party.
</p>
<p>
 Especially worthy of note, Iran also claims that the US denied it and its entities Fair and Equitable Treatment, treated them discriminatorily and unreasonably, and expropriated their assets – all claims familiar to investment jurisprudence, and based on Article IV of the Treaty of Amity, which provides:
</p>
<p>
 “1. Each High Contracting Party shall at all times accord fair and equitable treatment to nationals and companies of the other High Contracting Party, and to their property and enterprises; shall refrain from applying unreasonable or discriminatory measures that would impair their legally acquired rights and interests; and shall assure that their lawful contractual rights are afforded effective means of enforcement, in conformity with the applicable laws.”
</p>
<p>
 Iran’s FET claim focuses on Congress’s alleged attempt to retroactively change the applicable law in the middle of the Peterson et al. v Bank Markazi case, in order to facilitate enforcement of the damages awarded to the claimants in that case. Iran also stresses the discriminatory aspect of the law, as it explicitly targeted Iran and its properties.
</p>
<p>
 These claims had earlier been dismissed by US courts, which saw no discrimination based on nationality in the 2012 Act. Before the Supreme Court, the US government put the emphasis on the fact that Fair and Equitable Treatment is due to “nationals and companies” of Iran according to Article IV – a category that does not necessarily encompass government-held entities such as Bank Markazi. (The Supreme Court did not address this point, as it adopted the appeal court’s finding that the 2012 Act trumped treaty obligations in any event.)
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Other alleged breaches are based on international law as incorporated in the treaty
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Other claims made by Iran are grounded in customary international law obligations, such as its customary-law immunity from jurisdiction and enforcement (as opposed to the one provided in US law that was trumped by the combined effect of Executive Order 13599 and the 2012 Act). Iran argues that these immunities, which under international law shield states and their properties (with exceptions) from the jurisdiction of the courts in foreign states, are protected under Article IV.2 of the Treaty of Amity, which provides that:
</p>
<p>
 “2. Property of nationals and companies of either High Contracting Party, including interests in property, shall receive the most constant protection and security within the territories of the other High Contracting Party, in no case less than that required by international law. Such property shall not be taken except for a public purpose, nor shall it be taken without the prompt payment of just compensation. […]”
</p>
<p>
 In this respect, Iran probably hopes to rely on the the recent ICJ case concerning Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v Italy, Greece intervening), which adopted extensive interpretations of these customary-law immunities. Here as well, the US government could yet argue that Bank Markazi does not fall within the “nationals and companies” category.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  An interpretation of Fair and Equitable Treatment by the ICJ could prove influential
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 This is not the first time the ICJ could hear a dispute involving allegedly mistreated foreign economic entities; two earlier cases (Barcelona Traction and ELSI) occurred before the modern surge of investment disputes, but proved nonetheless a great source of inspiration for investment tribunals and parties alike.
</p>
<p>
 A more recent case pitting the Republic of Guinea vs the Democratic Republic of the Congo focused mostly on human rights, although investment arbitration jurisprudence appeared in the parties’ pleadings and in some judges’ individual opinions in that case (see, for example, the joint dissenting opinion of judges Al-Khasawneh and Yusuf,
 <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/103/16248.pdf">
  here
 </a>
 , citing Tecmed v Mexico).
</p>
<p>
 Nevertheless, this is one of the first opportunities for the International Court to deal directly with an investment dispute and, in particular, to offer an interpretation of the meaning of the Treaty’s Fair and Equitable Treatment provision. While Dame Rosalyn Higgins mentioned this legal standard in her 1996 Separate Opinion in the Oil Platforms case, it has never been at the centre of an ICJ dispute. Such an interpretation has the potential to shape future investment law as well.
</p>
<p>
 Conversely, the ICJ stands to be briefed by the parties on, and take account of, the investment jurisprudence that developed in the two decades since the Oil Platforms case.
