No referral to the CJEU on validity of intra-EU BIT   Readers will recall that this investment dispute has been transformed into a casus belli by the European Commission in its general stance against intra-EU Bilateral investment treaties (on this question, see our reporting here ).  Accordingly, the question of the Romania-Sweden BIT’s validity arose in this dispute as well, with the Commission supporting a reference by the High Court to the Court of Justice of the European Union.  However, the High Court agreed with the claimants that this question was irrelevant to the enforcement issue, and refused to proceed with such a reference. (In its record of the facts, the High Court recalled that, in any event, a similar reference had already been made by the German Federal Court of Justice – a fact we reported here ).
