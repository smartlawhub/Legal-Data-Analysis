Grant of immunity to state agency not a treaty breach in itself   Finally, the investor contested the propriety of BRA’s immunity for intentional torts that prevented the jury verdict to be entered against it. The investor contended that shielding one public authority from suit in respect of NAFTA breaches was, in itself, a breach of article 1105.  After taking inspiration from case-law from the European Court of Human Rights, and recording the parties’ debate over state practice in granting immunities to public bodies, the tribunal ultimately rejected the claimant’s analysis. If BRA’s immunity had shielded it in the local proceedings, it was from a verdict in tort and contractual matters, i.e., not from breaches of NAFTA. Indeed, the tribunal noted that immunity would not apply before a NAFTA tribunal. Thus, if a claimant were to lodge a claim (that otherwise fell within a tribunal’s jurisdiction) it could allege that the conduct of the locally-immune entity had triggered a breach of NAFTA protections.  On a different note, while the tribunal conceded that “… circumstances can be envisaged where the conferral of a general immunity from suit for conduct of a public authority affecting a NAFTA investment could amount to a breach of Article 1105(1) of NAFTA”, the tribunal nevertheless concluded that “… [W]ithin broad limits, the extent to which a State decides to immunize regulatory authorities from suit for interference with contractual relations is a matter for the competent organs of the State to decide.”  Although Mondev’s claims all failed, the tribunal noted in conclusion that it had “some sympathy” for the company’s ultimate situation, and slightly rebuked the city and BRA’s actions in the underlying dispute. Accordingly, each party bore its own costs and was ordered to pay half of the expenses for the tribunal and ICSID management.
