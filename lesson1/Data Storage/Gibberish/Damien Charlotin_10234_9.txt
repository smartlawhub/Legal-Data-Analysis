Tribunal orders the compensation to be tax-free   In addition to their main claims, the investors sought a ruling from the tribunal preventing Venezuela from taxing the compensation awarded, and to reimburse them for any fiscal duties incurred in their home jurisdiction with respect to this compensation. The reasoning behind this request was that, had Venezuela not breached the treaty, these fiscal duties would never had been incurred in the first place. To make the investors properly whole, the award needed to account for this possibility.  The tribunal partly acceded to this request: although it declined to order Venezuela to refrain from taxing the compensation, it specified that the $137 million plus interests owed to the investors should be net of taxes. At the same time, it refused to say anything about the potential fiscal obligations of the investors in repatriating these sums to Portugal and Luxembourg, judging that Venezuela should not be held responsible for the acts of other states.  This is not the first award to consider this dimension of investment claims: a similar request has been granted in another case against Venezuela, also chaired by Juan Fernandez-Armesto ( Rusoro v. Venezuela ), while the tribunal in Exxon v. Venezuela similarly refused to hold the state responsible for possible taxation of the award in other jurisdictions.
