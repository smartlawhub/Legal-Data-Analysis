 In final award in Murphy v Ecuador windfall levy case, tribunal finds no reason to add or subtract from previously-ordered compensation

 Arbitrators have issued their final award in a long-running dispute under the US-Ecuador bilateral investment treaty, the Murphy v. Ecuador case.

 (respondent’s nominee), centered on Murphy’s 20% interest in a consortium that had operated an oil block (Block 16) in Ecuador and which was subjected to a windfall levy (“Law 42”) on excess or extraordinary profits.*

 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/articles/in-latest-arbitral-ruling-on-ecuadors-decade-old-windfall-oil-levy-arbitrators-find-that-99-claw-back-but-not-a-50-claw-back-breached-investment-treaty/">
  As we’ve previously reported
 </a>
 , a 2016 “partial final award” had held Ecuador liable for a breach of the BIT’s fair and equitable treatment standard, but only for Ecuador’s imposition of a 99% levy on excess profits. (When the levy was set, for a time, merely at the rate of 50%, arbitrators considered that this less aggressive rate did
 <em>
  not
 </em>
 breach the FET standard.)
</p>
<p>
 At the time of the partial award, the tribunal held that Ecuador should pay $19.97 million US for the breach of the FET clause, as well as $7.1 million in pre-award interest. This compensation appears to have been equivalent to the amounts that had been remitted to Ecuador over the previous years in order to comply with the windfall levy.
</p>
<p>
 However, the partial award left undecided some questions of compensation. In particular, the arbitrators were not then in a position to rule on a second claim centered upon compensation for the difference between cash flows that would have been obtained
 <em>
  but-for
 </em>
 the windfall measures, and what the company actually received in 2009 when it sold its stake in the project to the consortium-operator Repsol (at a time when the windfall measures were in effect).
</p>
<p>
 The tribunal gave the parties time to try to settle on an adjustment of Murphy’s fair market value, and on the resulting sum Murphy was entitled to (the “Entitlement”). As the parties failed to reach such agreement, the case gave rise to further pleadings, with both parties seeking to modify the amount to be awarded. The final award, dated February 10, 2017, which puts an end to this dispute, can be

  Several attempts to reconsider the partial award are rejected
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 In this final award, the tribunal was careful not to engage in any reconsideration of its previous findings.
</p>
<p>
 Notably, the award reports that the claimant asked the tribunal to decide on some of its previous claims in light of the partial award’s holdings. The latter had found that, since Ecuador breached the Fair and Equitable Treatment in relation to the 99% levy, it was unnecessary to decide the claimants’ other contentions based on the BIT’s other protections.
</p>
<p>
 In the claimant’s view, this left the way open for a finding that the 50% levy, although it did not breach the FET standard, breached one of these other protections.
</p>
<p>
 The tribunal however sided with the respondent in holding that it had decided these non-FET claims when it found that these claims would leave the amount of damages awarded to Murphy unchanged. It rejected accordingly Murphy’s request as entailing an “unnecessary and duplicative reexamination of the merits”.
</p>
<p>
 Immediately following the partial award, the claimant had also requested the tribunal to make a finding (either by way of a supplementary decision or through reconsideration) on post-award interests on costs. The tribunal dismissed this claim in an as-yet unpublished procedural order, finding that Murphy did not present a specific claim in this respect during the proceedings. In a short paragraph in its recent final award, the tribunal refused to reconsider its partial award and the subsequent procedural order.
</p>
<p>
 Finally, the tribunal in the partial award had used Murphy Ecuador’s cash flows between 2009 and 2012 (the latter date marking the end of the participation contract in a
 <em>
  but-for
 </em>
 scenario) to arrive at its fair market value in 2009. In the claimant’s view, this analysis should be amended to take into account the new contractual framework negotiated with Repsol Ecuador when it bought Murphy’s stake, and which extended the participation contract to 2018. The claimants contended that this sum was factored into the sale price, but not into the fair market value found by the tribunal, resulting in lower compensation for Murphy.
</p>
<p>
 The respondent countered that such an adjustment was not included in the directions set out by the tribunal in the partial award. In any case, Ecuador added, this newly proposed calculation was at odds with the claimant’s previous position and lacked economic justification.
</p>
<p>
 Ultimately, the tribunal accepted Ecuador’s first counterargument, stressing that the partial award left undecided only one sort of adjustment to the fair market value of Murphy’s investment, i.e., the adjustment accounting for the claimant’s ongoing obligation under a 50% – as opposed to a 99% – windfall levy. Any other and additional adjustment would be “inconsistent with – and amount to a reconsideration of – the Partial Final Award”.
</p>
<p>
 The tribunal’s refusal to reconsider its previous findings should be read in the context of tribunals often debating whether they even have such power (see, e.g.,
 <a href="http://www.iareporter.com/articles/icsid-tribunal-skirts-question-of-powers-to-reconsider-prior-substantive-decisions/">
  here
 </a>
 ). In the present case, the tribunal did not particularly discuss this legal point, and seemed to proceed on the assumption that reconsideration requests were off-limits. By contrast, another award involving Ecuador recently elaborated on – and accepted, within certain limits – its power to reconsider previous findings, but rejected the state’s request on the merits (see our analysis

 </a>
 ).
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Ecuador’s proposed set-off is dismissed as heads of damages are “separate and distinct”
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 The heart of the tribunal’s analysis was that Murphy Ecuador was entitled to the difference between the adjusted fair market value and the price paid by Repsol for the 20% stake in Block 16.
</p>
<p>
 Yet, in Ecuador’s view, this amount should be a negative one, because the adjusted fair market value is below what Repsol actually paid for Murphy’s interest in the block. The respondent pointed to Murphy’s acknowledgment that this fair market value was lower in the scenario where the tribunal refuses to consider the Extension Contract and the non-FET claims (as eventually happened).
</p>
<p>
 For Ecuador, the claimant has then acknowledged that the sale to Repsol had fully mitigated its losses. As a result, Murphy’s overall compensation (including the amounts accounting for the excess payments under the 99% levy) should be reduced to nil thanks to a set-off.
</p>
<p>
 The respondent argued that the tribunal had the power and the duty to order such a set-off, and moreover argued that the offset was so significant that it should also tip the ultimate decision on costs towards Ecuador’s favour.
</p>
<p>
 In response, Murphy objected to what it deemed an “eleventh-hour attempt to convert the [E]ntitlement into a credit”, and asked the tribunal to deem this argument to be untimely. The investor also stressed that a set-off was not warranted between two different and unrelated heads of damages. Murphy argued that the sale to Repsol only mitigated the “post-sale forward-looking damages”, and not the other losses incurred by Murphy under the 99% levy. Lastly, the claimant sought to rely on the partial award’s language which, in its view, did not envisage the possibility of calculating a negative sum in this context.
</p>
<p>
 Murphy’s reasoning was ultimately followed by the tribunal: the two categories of damages were indeed “separate and distinct”. Although Repsol did pay more than the claimant’s idea of the fair market value as at 2009 (to the effect that the Entitlement was actually zero), this did not “mitigate” the “historical” losses incurred under the 99% levy, but only
 <em>
  future
 </em>
 damages. (The tribunal seemed however less convinced that Ecuador’s argument was untimely).
</p>
<p>
 As a result, the tribunal rejected Ecuador’s claim for a set-off and for costs in its favour and found that Murphy was not entitled to anything under this head of damages. Ecuador was then only liable for the damages already found in the partial award, and the pre-award interest applicable to that sum.
</p>
<p>
 Since the tribunal saw no clearly succeeding party in this last phase, it ordered the parties to bear their own costs.
