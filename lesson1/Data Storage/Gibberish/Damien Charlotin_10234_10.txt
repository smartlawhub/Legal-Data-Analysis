Free transfer clause in the treaty does not allow for taxes on the sums awarded   Lastly, the parties discussed the meaning and relevance of article 5 of the Luxembourg-Venezuela BIT, which provides that each party must allow free transfer of the other party’s investors’ funds, mentioning explicitly as an example the compensation awarded following an illegal expropriation. Article 5.3 adds that state parties must promptly deliver all authorizations necessary for such transfers, “and this, without other charges than the usual taxes and costs”.  In Venezuela’s reading, this latter provision meant that it was entitled to tax any compensation awarded to Tenaris if repatriated to Luxembourg.  The tribunal noted that some ambiguity could stem from the differences between the BIT’s two versions, in French and Spanish. Yet, since the BIT declared the French version as authoritative, the tribunal relied on it to reject Venezuela’s reading: the “usual costs and contributions” were related to the authorizations, not to the sums being transferred.  Following the loser-pays principle, the tribunal ordered the respondent to cover the administrative costs of the arbitration, with an added $2.1 million to the investors for the “reasonable” part of their costs.
