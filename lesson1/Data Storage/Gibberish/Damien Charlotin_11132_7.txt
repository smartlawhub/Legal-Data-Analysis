Technical assistance contract was a protected investment and could be compensated   The stake in OSM was only one part of SAUR’s investment in this case: it also signed a technical assistance contract with OSM in relation to the water concession, under which it was promised a management fee. In its decision on damages, the tribunal held that the sums expected under this contract – which were not paid following the termination of the water concession contract – should be compensated.  Argentina contested this whole part of the tribunal’s findings, arguing that the technical assistance contract was not a protected investment, and that the tribunal thus manifestly exceeded its powers by ruling in excess of its jurisdiction ratione materiae. The state also claimed that the tribunal’s reasoning was contradictory, notably where it both observed that SAUR hoped to disengage from OSM and this technical assistance contract in 2013, and yet held that this contract was to be performed until 2023 – and should thus be compensated on this basis.  The committee acknowledged that the technical assistance contract had caused some controversy during the arbitration, but noticed that Argentina only contested SAUR’s claims in this respect as being brought too late, not as referring to something that was not a protected investment. In any case, the tribunal eventually accepted that the claim for money under the contract was a protected investment under the treaty. As such, the compensation eventually awarded was not contractual in nature, but the direct consequence of the loss of this contract following Argentina’s treaty breach.  In the committee’s view, this interpretation was sound, and devoid of contradictions. In particular, the tribunal properly explained that SAUR’s hopes to walk away from its investment in OSM and from the technical assistance contract were the result of the very same actions attributable to Argentina, and as such were irrelevant for the assessment of damages.
