Criminal proceedings that Bolivia had maintained – in defiance of an earlier procedural order – are deemed irrelevant to the question of a stay   Further, the investors pointed to the ongoing criminal proceedings targeted at individuals in Bolivia related to the investment. Bolivia was requested to suspend these proceedings in an infamous provisional measures order issued by the tribunal in 2010 (see here ), as a result of which the relationship between Bolivia and ICSID soured dramatically (see here ). The claimants cited Bolivia’s failure to comply with this order as another ground that warrant the termination of the stay.  The committee, however, focused on the tribunal’s finding that these criminal proceedings, although they continued in breach of the provisional measures, did not amount to a treaty breach. Therefore, the committee reasoned, the continuation of these proceedings to this day was irrelevant in deciding to lift or continue the stay.
