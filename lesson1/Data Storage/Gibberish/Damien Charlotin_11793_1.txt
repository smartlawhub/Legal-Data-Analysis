US Court declines to set aside Mesa v. Canada award, and rejects investor’s argument that NAFTA tribunal breached due process by showing “deference” to government measures    Mesa Power Group LLC, who failed last year to obtain compensation from a NAFTA tribunal in an investment dispute hinging on measures in the Canadian province of Ontario, has failed in a bid to set aside the resulting award.  In a June 15, 2017 Memorandum Opinion, the US District Court for the District of Columbia has rejected Mesa Power’s petition.  We reviewed the 2016 NAFTA award here and here . Readers will recall that a majority of the tribunal of Arbitrator 
   (chair, appointed by ICSID, the appointing authority), Arbitrator 
   (Mesa Power’s appointee) and Arbitrator 
   (Canada’s appointee) decided that the measures challenged by Mesa Power entered the NAFTA’s definition of “procurement” and were thus only reviewable under the minimum standard of treatment in NAFTA’s article 1105. The award also interpreted article 1105 so that such review accorded a “good level of deference” to the regulatory choices and actions of the respondent state.  As we report below, both arbitral findings were unsuccessfully challenged by Mesa Power in the DC set aside proceedings.  Lewis Baach PLLC, Astigarrga Davis Mullins &amp; Grossman, PA, and Appleton &amp; Associates were counsels for the claimant in these set aside proceedings, while Reed Smith LLP assisted Canada’s team of in-house counsels.
