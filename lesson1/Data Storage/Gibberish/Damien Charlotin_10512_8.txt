Arbitration agreement valid, and Ghana is estopped from claiming otherwise   Turning to the arbitration agreement’s validity, the tribunal found that it was unaffected by article 181(5) of the constitution (and its requirement of parliamentary approval of certain transactions) – even if this article were deemed applicable under Dutch law – as the contract under scrutiny was not an “international business or economic transaction.”  Besides, the tribunal was satisfied that Ghana was estopped from contesting the jurisdiction of the tribunal. Citing Kardossopoulos v Georgia and ADC v Hungary, the tribunal noted that “the approval of business transactions by government officials not objected to as to their legality under local law, and relied upon for a number of years, have been held to amount to estoppel.” The tribunal stressed Ghana’s representations concerning the validity of both the PPA and the arbitration agreement (indeed, after relations deteriorated between the parties, it was Ghana – not the investor – that first adverted to the possible use of the contract’s arbitration provisions to resolve the dispute.).
