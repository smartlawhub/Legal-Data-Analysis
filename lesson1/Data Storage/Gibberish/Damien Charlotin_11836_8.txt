Parallel litigation in contractual dispute does not warrant stay of treaty dispute   Pakistan also contended that any treaty claim, insofar as it is linked to the contract, should not be heard by the tribunal while dispute-resolution mechanisms are provided in the contract and have not been exhausted. In support, Pakistan cited the earlier case of SGS v Philippines where the international arbitration had been stayed pending the outcome of the related, contract-based proceedings.  The tribunal was unpersuaded that a stay of the proceedings was appropriate in the Impregilo case. The tribunal was not persuaded that contractual arbitration procedings would be “undermined” by the parallel treaty-based proceedings, all the more since the parties to the former were different (GBC v Wapda). (The tribunal did not dwell on a different question: whether waiting for determinations of contractual questions by the contractually-prescribed tribunal could assist or inform the treaty-based tribunal’s own analysis as to whether treaty obligations have been breached)
