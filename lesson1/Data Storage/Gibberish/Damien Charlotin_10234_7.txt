Comsigua’s lack of debt irrelevant in determining the WACC   With respect to the DCF analysis of Comsigua, Venezuela objected to Compass Lexecon’s method to find this company’s WACC (the WACC is normally arrived at by weighing the costs of a company’s debt and equity). In Comsigua’s case, the investors’ experts’ WACC was based on an optimal capital structure with a debt/equity ratio of 19/81. But Venezuela pointed out that Comsigua was actually debt-free. Venezuela then objected to the opposing experts’ assumption of an optimal capital structure, and proposed that the discount rate be the sole cost of equity.  However, the tribunal accepted the investor’s argument that Comsigua’s actual liabilities were irrelevant to the determination of the WACC, which is always based on an optimal capital structure (i.e., the target capital structure for a potential buyer).  Based on this, the tribunal arrived at a value of $22.3 million for Talta’s 7.58% share in Comsigua.  As with its appraisal of Tavsa, the tribunal checked the result against other valuation methods. These alternatives included a “market multiple” method and a look at similar transactions (chiefly among them, the price once offered by Venezuela to the former majority investors in Comsigua). These checks established that $22.3 million was clearly in the lower band of possible valuations.  The tribunal thus found that its DCF analysis had led it to undervalue Talta’s share in Comsigua. It proceeded to assign to each possible alternative valuation (arrived at through the multiple method and the comparison with similar transactions) a weight depending on its relevance and appropriateness to Comsigua’s case. The average of these weighted alternative valuations led the tribunal to find that Talta’s stake was actually worth around $24.6 million, slightly more than what Venezuela once offered to pay.
