First tribunal did not decide the merits of the claim   Argentina proposed however another reading of the award: far from failing to decide the claims, the tribunal had actually taken a decision on the merits by allegedly concluding that Vivendi had no viable treaty claim and only contractual claims against the Tucumán province.  The committee disagreed with this reading. It stressed the parts of the award where the tribunal explained that it was impossible to decide on the treaty claims. As a result, the treaty claims remained outstanding. (These would be decided five years later by a second tribunal, as related in our second article on this saga.)  Following the first tribunal’s reasoning, the committee apportioned the costs of the annulment proceedings equally between the parties.
