No harm to public policy in holding a state to its international obligations   Venezuela also tried to rely on the alleged “public policy of the United States that States have the sovereign right to regulate the environmental impact of industrial activities”. As Crystallex’s woes allegedly arose due to Venezuela’ environmental concerns, confirming the award would harm this public policy interest.  The district court was unimpressed. It first noted the tribunal’s “serious doubts” that environmental concerns truly motivated Venezuela’s actions against Crystallex.  Further, according to the district court, confirming the award only meant holding Venezuela “to the terms of its own treaty”, in ordering it to compensate the investor for the results of its inequitable actions and expropriation. This would not violate the US’s “basic notions of morality or justice” – which is the threshold where public policy can warrant an award’s set aside.
