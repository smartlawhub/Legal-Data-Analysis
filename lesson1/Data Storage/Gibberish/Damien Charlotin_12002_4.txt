BIT is the applicable law   As an introduction to its analysis, the tribunal addressed the parties’ disagreement as to the law applicable to the question of jurisdiction. Equatorial Guinea argued that its domestic laws were solely applicable; the claimant pointed to the BIT.  The tribunal sided with the claimant, observing that, to follow Equatorial Guinea’s reasoning would entail that the jurisdiction of international tribunals constituted under the BIT could be subject to, and indeed possibly denied by, domestic laws – a situation in which international arbitration would lose its effectiveness. Equatorial Guinean law could still be relevant, the tribunal allowed, but only where the BIT explicitly refers to it.
