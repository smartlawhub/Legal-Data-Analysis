Inactive investor cannot benefit from unperfected adjudication process   GFHC also failed to prove that it had a qualifying investment in the Oyala project, as the majority found that to be considered an investment for jurisdictional purposes, the constitution of the company should have been followed, –per Equatorial Guinean law – by the signing of a contract in following thirty days.  The majority found no trace of such a contract or constitution of the company was published in the official journal, in accordance with procurement law. Since there was no evidence that the claimant had sought to sign the contract, or otherwise insisted on the perfection of the constitution process, the majority held that GFHC had renounced its right and was “uninterested” in investing in the Oyala project. Accordingly, there was no investment there either.
