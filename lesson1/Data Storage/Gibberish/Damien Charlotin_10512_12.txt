Investor had sought $500 million, but receives only restitution after both sides are deemed in breach   The claimant had sought more than $500 million in compensation from Ghana.  However, the rest of the final award , less interesting to IAReporter from a legal/policy perspective, eventually held both parties independently in breach and the PPA impossible to enforce. The tribunal thus deemed the contract to be terminated.  Damages totaling some $12 million as well as interest were granted on a restitution basis to the claimant.******
