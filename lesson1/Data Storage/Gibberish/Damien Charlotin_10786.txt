</p>
<p>
 Waste Management v. Mexico (II) is often cited for its analysis of the Fair and Equitable Treatment (FET) standard; but this dispute – which spawned two consecutive arbitrations – was also one of the first to involve issues such as waiver under NAFTA,
 <em>
  res judicata
 </em>
 , or the arbitrability of contractual disputes  that would become staples of later investment proceedings.
</p>
<p>
 Acaverde, the Mexican subsidiary of US-based Waste Management, Inc., was awarded a concession from the city of Acapulco to perform waste removal services in the city’s main tourist areas. The contractual framework included a line of credit from a Mexican government bank, Banobras, which served as a guarantor.
</p>
<p>
 The investor filed in 1998 a claim under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), under the ICSID’s Additional Facility Rules. It claimed that, on top of various other contractual breaches, Acapulco eventually refused to pay its invoices, while Banobras soon ceased guaranteeing these debts. This conduct allegedly breached NAFTA’s articles 1105 and 1110.
</p>
<p>
 However, as we discuss below, a first arbitration brought by the claimant was dismissed due to the investor’s failure to comply with the NAFTA’s waiver requirement. In a second proceeding, before a new tribunal, all of the investor’s claims were rejected.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  First proceedings before Cremades-chaired tribunal falter due to non-compliance with NAFTA Article 1121’s waiver requirement
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 The first tribunal was composed of Keith Highet (claimant’s appointee),
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/arbitrator/Siqueiros">
  Eduardo T. Siqueiros
 </a>
 (respondent’s appointee), with
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/arbitrator/Cremades">
  Bernardo Cremades
 </a>
 chairing.
</p>
<p>
 Mexico raised a preliminary objection regarding Waste Management’s compliance with NAFTA’s article 1121, which requires claimants to waive their right to initiate or continue certain parallel proceedings with respect to the same measures at issue in the NAFTA arbitration.
</p>
<p>
 Waste Management had sent a waiver to ICSID, but with a qualification: in its view, the waiver requirement was irrelevant for disputes that did not involve Mexico’s obligations under NAFTA.
</p>
<p>
 Mexico contested this waiver’s validity, noting that Acaverde remained involved in administrative and arbitral proceedings with Acapulco and Banobras over the same measures at stake in the ICSID dispute.
</p>
<p>
 In a decision dated June 2, 2000 [
 <a href="http://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/ita0892.pdf">
  click to download
 </a>
 ], the tribunal first found that the waiver requirement was an essential part of the NAFTA parties’ consent to arbitration. Such waivers should be expressed in clear terms, and tribunals are entitled to assess the formal terms of such waivers, as well as the claimant’s material compliance (which should be judged at the time the waiver was submitted).
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Waiver obligation bars simultaneous pursuit of local proceedings targeting the same measures – even if NAFTA breaches are not asserted locally
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 In this case, the tribunal deemed that Waste Management had failed to materially comply with its own waiver. Contrary to the claimant’s view, Article 1121 sought to prevent duplicative proceedings, meaning that the local proceedings targeting the same measures were still problematic even if they did not assert a breach of NAFTA.
</p>
<p>
 Since Waste Management chose to continue the Mexican proceedings after submitting its waiver, it was deemed defective. No later action from the claimant could cure this defect. The tribunal therefore held that it lacked jurisdiction, and it ordered the claimant to pay the arbitration’s costs (although Mexico was left to bear its own defence costs).
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Dissenter would not have dismissed first arbitration
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 In dissent, arbitrator Keith Highet took issue (in particular) with the tribunal’s main premise that it was entitled to assess the investor’s compliance with the waiver. In his view, in providing for formal submission of the waiver, article 1121 merely offers respondents a tool they are free to use in parallel proceedings they wish to stop; assessing the claimant’s compliance with a waiver would deprive the waiver’s formal requirements of purpose (since it would be enough to just mandatorily bar claimants from pursuing other remedies). Besides, and contrary to what the majority considered, the waiver related to the admissibility of the claim and not to the tribunal’s jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
 Despite this dissent, subsequent tribunals have tended to follow the majority’s reasoning – finding that a claimant’s failure to comply with the waiver requirement could deny a tribunal jurisdiction over a claim – even if only partially (see, e.g., our discussion of
 <a href="http://www.iareporter.com/articles/tribunal-rejects-guatemalas-objection-to-jurisdiction-in-cafta-railroad-dispute-but-claimants-waiver-precludes-some-claims/">

 ).

  As we reported last July
 </a>
 , Peru successfully raised a similar objection in its dispute against investor Renco. Like Waste Management, Renco immediately undertook to resubmit its claim to a second tribunal.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Second tribunal considers the relevance of previous award for new proceedings*
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Undaunted, Waste Management initiated new proceedings a few weeks later, on June 19, 2000. This led to the constitution of a tribunal with Benjamin R. Civiletti (claimant’s appointee), Eduardo Magallón Gómez (respondent’s appointee), and
 <a href="https://www.iareporter.com/arbitrator/Crawford">
  James R. Crawford
 </a>
 presiding.**
</p>
<p>
 Mexico challenged the investor’s right to file this new submission: in its view, NAFTA’s Chapter 11 offered investors only one opportunity to seek international redress.
</p>
<p>
 In a preliminary decision dated June 26, 2002 [
 <a href="http://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/ita0898.pdf">
  click to download
 </a>
 ], the tribunal rejected Mexico’s contention, finding that it was not borne out by the treaty’s language, nor by general international law.
</p>
<p>
 The tribunal also sided with the investor on the issue of
 <em>
  res judicata
 </em>
 : contrary to Mexico’s contentions, the first award had
 <em>
  res judicata
 </em>
 implications only on issues it considered, i.e., only on the first waiver’s validity. As the award said nothing of the merits of the case, this new tribunal was not barred from ruling on them.
</p>
<p>
 The tribunal’s engagement with the
 <em>
  res judicata
 </em>
 effect of previous proceedings was one of the first in the investment treaty arbitration realm. Worthy of note, the test applied by the tribunal (identity of parties and of the issue decided) was the same adopted (after more debate) in some later NAFTA arbitrations, such as
 <a href="http://www.iareporter.com/articles/split-between-arbitrators-on-res-judicata-issue-comes-into-focus-as-award-is-released-from-nafta-pharmaceutical-arbitration/">
  Apotex v. USA
 </a>
 .
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Investor’s resubmission not an abuse of process
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Mexico’s also argued that the resubmission, seen in the light of the first case and the domestic proceedings, should be viewed as an abuse of process.
</p>
<p>
 The tribunal however was satisfied that the claimant “properly submitted [its claim] within the framework of the remedies open to it” – which was not deemed abusive.
</p>
<p>
 Since this was a clear-cut situation, the tribunal refrained from offering a broader opinion as to its “inherent power” to refuse jurisdiction in face of abuse. Thus, it would fall to future tribunals to explore this question further.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Indirect shareholding protected under NAFTA
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 In its final award on the merits of May 31, 2004 [
 <a href="http://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/ita0900.pdf">
  click to download
 </a>
 ], the tribunal swiftly dismissed Mexico’s last jurisdictional objection, based on Waste Management’s indirect ownership (via entities in the Cayman Islands) of Acaverde. For the arbitrators, NAFTA clearly covered an indirectly-held investment.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Tribunal interprets the standard of review under article 1105
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 On the merits, Waste Management argued that Mexico breached NAFTA’s article 1105, as Acaverde was a victim of arbitrariness, lack of due process and denial of justice in its relations with the Mexican authorities.
</p>
<p>
 Before addressing this claim, the tribunal chose to clarify the scope of NAFTA’s article 1105. Relying on previous NAFTA jurisprudence and on the Free Trade Commission’s interpretation of this article (as found in the FTC’s August 2001
 <a href="http://www.naftaclaims.com/commissionfiles/NAFTA_Comm_1105_Transparency.pdf">
  Notes of interpretation
 </a>
 ), the tribunal accepted that the FET standard was linked to the minimum standard of treatment under international law, and evolved along with it. More explicitly, the tribunal deemed that a breach of FET could be found only:
</p>
<p>
 “if the [impugned] conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory […], or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety – as might be the case with […] a complete lack of transparency and candour […].” A breach “of representations made by the host State which were reasonably relied on by the claimant” is also relevant in this finding.
</p>
<p>
 This interpretation has proved influential: not only in disputes under NAFTA or similarly-worded treaties (
 <a href="http://www.iareporter.com/articles/analysis-cafta-tribunal-adopts-earlier-nafta-tribunals-reading-of-minimum-standard-damages-conditioned-on-investors-handing-back-keys-to-railway/">
  see our analysis
 </a>
 of RDC v. Guatemala***), but also in non-NAFTA disputes (e.g.,
 <a href="http://www.iareporter.com/articles/arbitrators-scrutinize-investors-complaints-about-conduct-of-their-local-bank-and-the-states-responsibility-for-alleged-harms/">
  MNSS v. Montenegro
 </a>
 ). Notably, in
 <a href="http://www.iareporter.com/articles/tribunal-sees-a-high-bar-for-breach-of-naftas-minimum-standard-of-protection-doubts-expressed-as-to-impact-of-hundreds-of-bits-on-customary-international-law/">
  Cargill v. Mexico
 </a>
 this seemingly “deferential” FET standard was contrasted with the apparently more stringent one adopted by the award in Tecmed v. Mexico (
 <a href="http://www.iareporter.com/articles/looking-back-tecmed-v-mexico-breaks-ground-in-adopting-expansive-reading-of-the-fair-and-equitable-treatment-and-upholding-protection-of-investors-legitimate-expectations/">
  which we reviewed here
 </a>
 ).
</p>
<p>
 Yet, the tribunal’s analysis continued to be criticized by respondent-states for its failure to ground its interpretation on a proper analysis of
 <em>
  state practice
 </em>
 (see our analysis of Canada’s argument in
 <a href="http://www.iareporter.com/articles/canada-files-counter-memorial-in-quebec-fracking-case-defending-provinces-environmental-choices/">
  Lone Pine
 </a>
 ). The standard’s concern for the investor’s legitimate expectations is also an ongoing source of contention:
 <a href="http://www.iareporter.com/articles/as-decision-in-mesa-v-canada-looms-investor-and-all-three-nafta-parties-weigh-in-on-significance-of-bilcon/">
  as we reported
 </a>
 , this was one of the major debates in Mesa v. Canada, and especially with respect to the
 <a href="http://www.iareporter.com/articles/majority-of-nafta-chapter-11-tribunal-finds-national-treatment-and-minimum-standard-breaches-in-environmental-review-of-controversial-nova-scotia-quarry/">
  Bilcon tribunal’s prior endorsement
 </a>
 of this standard. (Nonetheless, the Mesa tribunal eventually
 <a href="http://www.iareporter.com/articles/in-mesa-award-waste-mgt-reading-of-fet-is-embraced-despite-post-bilcon-criticisms-but-majority-offers-much-deference-to-state-policy-choices-mfn-access-to-stronger-fet-is-nixed/">
  unanimously endorsed this interpretation
 </a>
 .)
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  NAFTA is not an insurance policy against bad business judgments
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 On the merits, the tribunal stressed the effects of a recent Mexican financial crisis as a background to the dispute. The tribunal then swiftly dismissed the FET allegations against Banobras and the Mexican state of Guerrero to focus on the conduct of Acapulco.
</p>
<p>
 The tribunal acknowledged the city’s failures to comply with the contractual framework. But it also noted that they were not solely to blame for Acaverde’s woes, as its business plan was deficient from the start.
</p>
<p>
 Besides, Acapulco’s actions could be “explained, albeit not excused” by its dire financial situation. On the whole, although defective in contractual terms, this conduct did not amount to a breach of the standard of treatment – especially since the investor had judicial remedies available.
</p>
<p>
 The investor had tried these remedies, albeit without success in its claims. The tribunal saw no denial of justice in these circumstances. Indeed, Acaverde’s arbitration against the City was discontinued on Acaverde’s own motion, and the (allegedly wrongful) conduct of the proceedings could not be attributed to Mexico, absent evidence of collusion with the arbitral institution.
</p>
<p>
 Similarly, the tribunal stressed that it was not “not a further court of appeal […] in respect of the decisions of the federal courts of NAFTA parties”. The treatment by Mexican courts of Acaverde’s claims suffered from no obvious defects. Acapulco’s conduct in these proceedings were not a denial of justice either, for it “is not unusual for litigants to be difficult and obstructive”.
</p>
<p>
 The investor also complained of the city’s alleged wrongful termination of the concession, and the city’s attempt to collect a performance bond, however the tribunal rejected these claims: the former as not reaching the threshold of a treaty claim, the latter as having caused no loss to the claimant since it was unsuccessful. Lastly, while the tribunal accepted that a “deliberate conspiracy” to frustrate the investor’s protections under the treaty could be a breach, the investor failed to demonstrate the existence of such conspiracy.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Contractual breaches, on their own, are not an expropriation
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 In a last step, the tribunal considered whether Mexico expropriated Waste Management’s investment. This claim had two aspects: that the conduct of Acapulco resulted in a “creeping expropriation” which rendered valueless Acaverde’s concession; and that its contractual rights were virtually expropriated due Acapulco’s failure to pay.
</p>
<p>
 Despite reviewing the case law on this point, the tribunal held that it was unnecessary to reach a final decision on the meaning of “tantamount to expropriation” (and in particular, on whether the Metalclad award’s interpretation –
 <a href="http://www.iareporter.com/articles/looking-back-metalclad-v-mexico-tribunal-finds-expropriation-and-fet-breaches-in-landfill-approvals-process/">
  discussed here
 </a>
 – was too broad): no expropriation could be discerned in this case.
</p>
<p>
 On the first aspect, the tribunal observed that at every moment Acaverde had control and use of its property. The tribunal stressed that “an enterprise is not expropriated just because its debts are not paid or other contractual obligations towards it are breached.”
</p>
<p>
 Further, and given the distinction between contractual breaches and treaty breaches (see below), the claimant had to “show an effective repudiation of [its] right, unredressed by any remedies available […], which has the effect of preventing its exercise entirely or to a substantial extent.” The claimant failed to do so. Insofar as Acaverde had judicial redress available, Acapulco’s failures to perform could not be qualified as an expropriation.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  “The law of breach of contract is not secreted in the interstices of Article 1110 of NAFTA.”
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 The tribunal’s reasoning under both articles 1105 and 1110 was strongly informed by the distinction between contractual breaches (which were undeniable here) and treaty breaches. To qualify as a treaty breach, the tribunal noted that a contractual breach needs to be accompanied with some governmental action, or with a denial of justice. This distinction has been drawn in a number of other subsequent cases (see, e.g.,
 <a href="http://www.iareporter.com/articles/24957/">
  Crystallex v. Venezuela
 </a>
 ).
</p>
<p>
 Importantly, the tribunal’s analysis was dependent on the absence of an “umbrella clause” in NAFTA – the tribunal noted that such a clause could commit a “host state to comply with its contractual commitment”. (The award thus steps lightly over a debate on the proper reading of umbrella clauses, which has seen sometimes divergent views taken over the years.)
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Threat to expropriate not an expropriation
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Ultimately, the “nearest the claimant came to show” an expropriation was with respect to Acapulco’s mayor’s public statement that the concession agreement should be “eliminated”. However, the tribunal found that no action followed this political statement made “in the heat of public debate”; as such, it could not amount to an expropriation.
</p>
<p>
 <a href="http://www.iareporter.com/articles/in-uncitral-award-arbitrators-refuse-to-enjoin-an-expropriation-and-later-find-that-mere-threat-of-taking-does-not-breach-investment-treaty/">
  Readers will recall
 </a>
 that in a couple of arbitrations involving Poland, tribunals later found that a threatened expropriation was not a treaty breach in itself, pending the enactment of expropriatory measures.
</p>
<p>
 Although Waste Management’s claims all failed, each party was left to bear its own costs.
</p>
<p>
 Waste Management was represented in both phases of the dispute by Baker &amp; Botts LLP; Mexico was represented by in-house counsel, and assisted by Thomas &amp; Partners.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
 * In a preliminary procedural ruling, the tribunal accepted to seat the proceedings in Washington, D.C., as asked by the investor against Mexico’s preference for Canada. The tribunal reasoned that, as the first dispute took place there (with no objection from Mexico), it would be unfortunate to adopt a different course in the new proceedings.
</p>
<p>
 ** Guillermo Aguilar Alvarez was originally appointed by Mexico; however, he resigned after Mexico later made a communication “which did not, however, amount to a challenge”. of its appointee. While similar events occurred in
 <em>
  Tecmed v. Mexico
 </em>
 at the same time, it is unclear what prompted Mr Alvarez’s resignation.
</p>
<p>
 *** James Crawford also sat on the tribunal that decided this dispute.
