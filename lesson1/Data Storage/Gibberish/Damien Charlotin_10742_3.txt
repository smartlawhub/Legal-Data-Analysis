No independent obligation to create a stable and transparent regulatory environment   Article 10(1) ECT encompasses several obligations of treatment often found in investment treaties. This article starts thus: “Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area.”  Interpreting this article, the tribunal rejected the claimant’s argument that this first sentence encapsulated an obligation for states to create stable and transparent conditions for investments. In the tribunal’s reading, this obligation existed only as part of already existing standards, such as the FET standard and the associated obligation to respect investors’ legitimate expectations.
