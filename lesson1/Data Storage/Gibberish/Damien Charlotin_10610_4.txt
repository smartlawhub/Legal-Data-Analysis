Tribunal reads no “implicit disconnection” clause into the ECT   As a first step, the tribunal concluded that the ECT’s article 26 allows for intra-EU disputes, as it founded the jurisdiction of the tribunal with respect to disputes “between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former.” The ECT elsewhere describes “Area” as the “territory” over which a Contracting Party has sovereignty, and held that it is uncontested that Spain has such a territory.  For the tribunal, the investor, incorporated in a Contracting State with its own territory distinct from Spain’s, had brought its claim against Spain proper for an investment in Spanish territory, and not against the EU (whose territory is composed of all Member States’ territories). Therefore, the claim fell properly under article 26 and the tribunal had jurisdiction. (The same analysis, focused on the word “Area” in article 26, coloured the Charanne tribunal’s reasoning on this question.)  ( As we reported , the tribunal in Blusun v. Italy cited the outcome in the Isolux v. Spain case similar arguments by the European Commission and Italy. In the event, both tribunals reached the same conclusion, as had the RREEF v Spain tribunal before that in its decision on jurisdiction.)
