“The law of breach of contract is not secreted in the interstices of Article 1110 of NAFTA.”   The tribunal’s reasoning under both articles 1105 and 1110 was strongly informed by the distinction between contractual breaches (which were undeniable here) and treaty breaches. To qualify as a treaty breach, the tribunal noted that a contractual breach needs to be accompanied with some governmental action, or with a denial of justice. This distinction has been drawn in a number of other subsequent cases (see, e.g., Crystallex v. Venezuela ).  Importantly, the tribunal’s analysis was dependent on the absence of an “umbrella clause” in NAFTA – the tribunal noted that such a clause could commit a “host state to comply with its contractual commitment”. (The award thus steps lightly over a debate on the proper reading of umbrella clauses, which has seen sometimes divergent views taken over the years.)
