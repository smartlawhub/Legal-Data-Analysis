Legality requirement only relevant for the investment’s establishment   Studying the contours of the legality requirement, the tribunal found that it had a temporal dimension, such that only breaches of Uzbek law made at the time the investment was made, and in relation to that investment, could unravel the tribunal’s jurisdiction over the case.  As noted by the tribunal, this meant that any “illegal action by Claimants at a later date or an illegal action unrelated to the making of the investment” will need to be determined at the merits stage – but not under the BIT’s legality requirement.
