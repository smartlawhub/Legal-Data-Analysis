Change of seat request denied   Mexico also renewed its request in favour of Toronto as the seat of the arbitration over Washington, DC (the tribunal had decided this issue in an earlier procedural order, see here ). Mexico explained that it was “now clear” that Lion is nothing but an investment vehicle for US interests, with no “real ties” to Canada, making a Canadian seat the most neutral option.  The tribunal rejected the request as untimely, unconnected to “the issue at this procedural stage,” and saw no need to alter its previous decision regarding the arbitration’s seat, as the facts and legal basis underpinning it had not changed.
