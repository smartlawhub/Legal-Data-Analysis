Unpacking the Orascom TMT v. Algeria award: Luxembourg investor clears jurisdictional objections but later sees its claims inadmissible     As we reported a few days ago , an ICSID tribunal has put an end to Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris’ efforts to resort to international arbitration over past frictions with the Algerian authorities in relation to telecoms company Djezzy, which Mr Sawiris developed to become the leader in the Algerian mobile network market.  Below, and in a companion article , we report more fully on the award’s reasoning that found the claims of Mr Sawiris’ Luxembourg-based investment vehicle, Orascom TMT Investments Sàrl (OTMTI), inadmissible.  The tribunal of Arbitrator 
   (chair, appointed by the parties upon the co-arbitrators’ proposal), Arbitrator 
   (claimant’s appointee), and Arbitrator 
   (Algeria’s appointee) was constituted under the BIT between Algeria and the Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union (BLEU). The bifurcated proceedings were held in English and French.   We reported on the beginnings of this dispute in 2012, when the claimant argued that harassment and mistreatment by the Algerian authorities had compelled it to sell its stake in Egyptian company Orascom Telecom Holding (OTH, Djezzy’s direct and majority shareholder) to Russian telecoms company VimpelCom at a loss.  Notably, OTH (now controlled by VimpelCom) then filed its own UNCITRAL arbitration in 2012 under the Algeria-Egypt BIT. This latter case was suspended in 2014 , when VimpelCom agreed to sell a majority stake to Algeria.* The latest award reveals, however, that the OTH arbitration resumed in 2015, before being definitively settled in a March 12, 2015 consent award. As explained below, the relationship between the two arbitrations would be crucial in finding OTMTI’s claims inadmissible.  White &amp; Case represented the claimant in these proceedings; Algeria was assisted by Shearman &amp; Sterling.
