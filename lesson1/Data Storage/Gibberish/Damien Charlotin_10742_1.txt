In now-public Isolux v. Spain award, measures that later breached investor protections in Eiser case were not deemed to breach Isolux’s legitimate expectations    As revealed in a separate introductory report , IAReporter have obtained a copy of the July 2016 award in Isolux v. Spain. Below, we analyse the tribunal’s handling of the merits of the case, as well as the dissenting arbitrator’s opinion.  The majority of the tribunal of Arbitrator 
   (chair), Arbitrator 
   (investor’s appointee) and Arbitrator 
   (Spain’s appointee) found that Spain did not breach the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) in implementing a new regulatory regime to govern investments in solar-power plants from 2012 to 2014. The majority reasoned that the changes could not breach the claimant’s legitimate expectations at the time it invested, and found that no expropriation occurred, as the investor’s returns have actually surpassed expectations.  Isolux was assisted in these proceedings by Bird &amp; Bird, LLP in Spain and Latham &amp; Watkins, LLP’s Paris office; Spain relied on its in-house counsel.
