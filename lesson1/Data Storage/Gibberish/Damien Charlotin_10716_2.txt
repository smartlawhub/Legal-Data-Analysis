Claimant had several avenues to arbitration   The tribunal’s reasoning was grounded in the case’s factual circumstances. The chain of ownership between Mr Sawiris and Djezzy meant that he had several options to bring the state before an international forum: the dispute could have been brought by Djezzy directly under the original Investment Agreement which provided for ICSID arbitration; by the direct shareholder, Orascom Telecom Holding (OTH), under the Algeria-Egypt BIT; by Weather Investments (which owned OTH) under the Algeria-Italy BIT; or by OTMTI (formerly Weather Investments II, and which owns Weather Investments) under the Algeria-BLEU BIT.  In the event, Mr Sawiris sent a notice of dispute on behalf of OTH to the state in 2010 under the Algeria-Egypt BIT, before his stake in OTH had been sold to VimpelCom. Another notice of dispute, also signed by Mr Sawiris, was filed by Weather Investments a few days later under the Italy-Algeria treaty. OTMTI’s own notice of dispute, however, was filed only later, in 2012.  Notably, OTH eventually acted upon its notice of dispute and initiated UNCITRAL proceedings in 2012. These proceedings were ultimately settled in 2015, when a consent award embodied the sale of 51% of Djezzy to an Algerian state-owned investment fund, and put an end to all remaining claims.  Algeria built a multifaceted argument upon this factual backdrop. The state argued, for example, that there was no “dispute” under OTMTI and Algeria because Mr Sawiris had reportedly been satisfied of the sale of Weather Investments to VimpelCom; that any dispute was actually between Mr Sawiris and Algeria, and was based on personal reasons; that OTMTI lacked standing to arbitrate given that OTH had sent a notice of dispute first and thereby deprived OTMTI of its right to arbitrate ( droit d’agir ); and that, alternatively, OTMTI sold its droit d’agir together with Weather Investments, or that the settlement between OTH and Algeria extinguished all claims and should be respected by the tribunal.
