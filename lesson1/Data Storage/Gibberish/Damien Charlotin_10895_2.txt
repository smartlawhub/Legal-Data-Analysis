Uzbekistan hopes to replicate former success around “legality requirement”   As discussed here , the tribunal rejected nationality-based objections, as well as objections focused on the definition of investor and investment.  The remaining two objections analysed in the March 8, 2017 decision on jurisdiction stem largely from the same essential contention by the respondent: that the claimants’ investment was made in contravention of the BIT’s “legality requirement”.  Readers will have in mind Uzbekistan’s former dispute against Israel-investor Metal-Tech Ltd., which foundered upon a finding that the investor had breach Uzbek anti-corruption laws (we reported on this case here , here and here ; that case figures extensively in our discussion of Uzbekistan’s fourth jurisdictional objection .) In another case, that of Oxus v Uzbekistan , the state had been less successful over a similar legality objection (but which did not concern anti-corruption laws).
