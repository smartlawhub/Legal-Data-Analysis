Unusual BIT provision guarantees “complete and unconditional legal protection”, but tribunal sidesteps it   At the outset, the tribunal acknowledged that Article 2(2) of the Russia-Ukraine BIT provided for an unusual and seemingly broad guarantee: “the complete and unconditional legal protection of investments made by investors of the other Contracting Party.” However, as we discuss below, the tribunal preferred to import (via an MFN clause) the more familiar fair and equitable treatment (FET) and full protection and security standards and to analyse Ukraine’s behaviour primarily against those standards.  The tribunal did muse briefly on the meaning of the more unusual provision, observing that case law is scarce. (Although the parties discussed one of the numerous cases involving Russian investor Yury Bogdanov against Moldova , the tribunal distinguished that prior case on the basis that it did not pertain to decisions by the host state’s courts). However, the tribunal supposed that this standard might be easier to breach than the customary international law standard of denial of justice.*  While the tribunal sidestepped application of the standard in this case, the provision would seem likely to be examined in future cases, given the large number of currently-pending cases under the Russia-Ukraine BIT. (Indeed, Mr Brower sits on the tribunal in one such case, Oschadbank v. Russia .)
