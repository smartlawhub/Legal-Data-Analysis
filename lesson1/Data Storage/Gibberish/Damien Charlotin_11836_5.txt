Umbrella clause – even if it could be imported via MFN clause – would not apply to contract between investor and state instrumentality   Likewise, the tribunal did not need to decide whether MFN clauses could import umbrella clauses from other treaties, as these clauses cover commitments between the state and the investor – and do not extend to separate entities (such as WAPDA).  It would fall to later tribunals to decide whether umbrella clauses can be so imported. For example, the tribunal in EDFI v Argentina found that it could (see here ), whereas the tribunal in Ickale v Turkmenistan found that the (admittedly, more narrowly-drafted) underlying BIT did not allow such import (see here ).
