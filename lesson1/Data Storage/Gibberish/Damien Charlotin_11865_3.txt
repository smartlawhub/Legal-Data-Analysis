Eskosol sees no power to order security for costs, and stressed that it has an insurance policy to cover adverse arbitration costs   Eskosol, for its part, contested the power of the tribunal to order security for costs, and explained that Italy had no “right per se to be awarded its costs here” any such right was speculative and could not ground Italy’s provisional request. The claimant also stressed that Italy’s request was mostly based upon the fact that Eskosol is in a situation of bankruptcy; as this bankruptcy was (allegedly) the result of Italy’s wrongful acts to begin with, the claimant decried Italy’s attempt to “benefit from its own misconduct.”  In any case, the claimant revealed that it has obtained an after-the-event (ATE) insurance policy that would cover adverse costs up to a total of €1million. In the claimant’s view, this deprived Italy’s request of any relevance.
