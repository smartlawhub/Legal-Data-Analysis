No evidence that Mexico breached other treaty clauses   Turning to other BIT protections, Tecmed argued that Mexico should also be liable, under the ‘full protection and security’ clause, for various protests that occasionally prevented it from operating the landfill. Tecmed lastly contended that INE’s actions were discriminatory, and breached obligations on the promotion and admission of investments.  However, the tribunal rejected the claimant’s contentions. After noting that “the guarantee of full protection and security is not absolute and does not impose strict liability upon the State”, the tribunal held that the claimant had failed to make out this claim. A similar conclusion was reached on the other remaining claims.
