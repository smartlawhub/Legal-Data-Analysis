    "All very good, now, here are the basic patterns:\n",
    "<ul><li>Any particular word or exact spelling will match itself: \"cake\" will match \"cake\" (but not \"Cake\", unless you command regex to be case-insensitive);</li>\n",
    "    <li>\".\", catches anything, really, except a newline;</li>\n",
    "    <li>\\s matches white spaces, including line breaks, etc.; note that the upper-case version, \\S, matches anything <i>but</i> a white space; and</li>\n",
    "    <li>\\w matches a letter, while \\W matches anything but a letter.</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "In addition, the following rules apply\n",
    "<ul><li>Square brackets can be used to indicate a range of characters, such as \"[0-8a-q]\" will only look for a number between 0 and 8 OR a letter between a and q;</li>\n",
    "    <li>The symbol \"|\" (that's Alt + 6 on your keyboard) means \"or\";</li>\n",
    "    <li>You'd indicate the expected number of hits with braces: [A-Z]{3} means you are looking for three (consecutive) upper-case letters between A and Z, while [A-Z]{3,6} means you expect between 3 and 6, and [A-Z]{3,} means \"at least 3\" (but potentially more). Two special characters do the same job, but open-ended, \"+\" means that you are expected at least one hit, while \"*\" means you expect any number of hits (including none);</li>\n",
    "    <li>Any pattern becomes optional if you add a \"?\" behind it: \"cakey?\" will find \"cakey\" or \"cake\"; and</li>\n",
    "    <li>You can group patterns by bracketing them with parentheses, and then build around it: for instance, \"([0-8a-q])|([9r-z])\". You can even name the groups to retrieve them precisely from the regex object when there is a match.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Characters that are usually used for patterns (such as \"?\" or \"|\") can be searched for themselves by \"escaping\" them with an anti-slash \"\\\" (and the antislash can be escaped with another antislash: \"\\\\\" will look for \"\\\")</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Regex really turns powerful in that you can add a number of conditions to you regex pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul><li>A pattern preceded by a \"^\" will be looked for unly at the beginning of a line; a pattern followed by a $ will only look for it if it finishes the line;</i>\n",
    "    <li>Adding a \"(?=2ndpattern)\" <i>after</i> your first pattern will indicate that your first pattern will match <i>only if</i> the target text matches your second pattern, but the second pattern won't be caught by the regex object (this is very useful, e.g., for substitution).</li>\n",
    "    <li>In the same vein, \"(?!2ndpattern)\", \"(?&lt;=2ndpattern)\", and \"(?!&lt;2ndpattern)\" are conditions for \"if it does not match after\"; \"if it matches before\", and \"if it doesn't match before\", respectively.</li>    \n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Latest versions of regex also provides for fuzzy searches - that is, with a bit of leeway to catch things despite errors in the pattern (this is exponentially greedy in resources, though, so be careful when you use it). For instance, re.search(\"(coke){e<=1}\", poem), where the braced statement means \"one or less errors (e)\" will find \"cake\", as there is only one difference (the latter o/a) between the pattern and the word. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there are so-called <i>flags</i> that are typically used outside of the pattern (but can be used inside for a single sub-pattern), as a third argument, to indicate further instructions, such as:\n",
    "<ul><li>Ignorecase, \"re.I\"</li>\n",
    "    <li>Ignore linebreaks \"re.S\"</li>\n",
    "    <li>Verbose (allows you to add white spaces that don't count as pattern), \"re.X\"</li>\n",
    "    <li>Multilines ($ and ^ will work for any single line, and not simply for the start and end of the full text), \"re.M\"</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Regex count as boolean: \"if sear\" will return \"True\" if there was a match, while you check for a null result by asking \"if sear is None\".\n",
