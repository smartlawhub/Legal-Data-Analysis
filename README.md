# Data-Analytics-SFJI

This course will introduce students to basic and common data analysis methods and
tools, as applied in particular to legal data and legal knowledge.
No pre-requisite required; the course will start from the ground up. Students will only need
a computer and an internet connection.
The course is aimed at all students interested in data analytics, since the skills learned on
the basis of legal datasets are transferable to any kind of data. The lessons will elaborate
on why mastering these skills are critical for their role in the digital economy.
The course should be of particular interest for students who want to work in tech start-ups
(especially legal techs), consulting firms, in research, or in devising public policy. Students
will also learn how data can be used in a variety of business applications and become
familiar with jobs accessible to them in that field (Data Analyst, Data Scientist).

OBJECTIVES
At the end of the course, students should be able to:
1. Identify and constitute a dataset;
2. Analyse that dataset;
3. Develop measures, metrics, and categories to explore and explain the data;
and
4. Identify technological “needs” and devise a proof of concept.

SCHEDULE AND TOPICS
The course is designed as a gradual introduction to Python and relevant methods of legal
data analysis.
