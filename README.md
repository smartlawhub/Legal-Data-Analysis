<h1>Legal Data Analytics</h1>

<b>This course will introduce students to basic and common data analysis methods and tools, as applied in particular to legal data and legal knowledge.</b>

No pre-requisite required; the course will start from the ground up. Students will only need a computer and an internet connection.

The course is aimed at all students interested in data analytics, since the skills learned on the basis of legal datasets are transferable to any kind of data. The lessons will elaborate on why mastering these skills are critical for their future career in the digital economy. 

The course should be of particular interest for students who want to work in tech start-ups (especially legal techs), law firms, academia, or in devising public policy. Students will also learn how data can be used in a variety of business applications.

At the end of the course, students should be able to:

1.	Identify and constitute a dataset;
2.	Develop measures, metrics, and categories to explore and explain the data; and
3.	Identify technological “needs” and devise a proof of concept.

The course is designed as a gradual introduction to Python and relevant methods of legal data analysis, within a 24-hour schedule. The first 12/16 hours are meant to be a sufficient introduction for the purpose of the Final Presentation; the latter hours are reserved for more specialised methods and uses.

Each course will be built around three elements:

•	Some opening considerations of a theoretical nature;
•	Practical teaching, based on python scripts that students will run on their computer. Students will be invited to fiddle with the pre-inputted code and discover by themselves its limits; and
•	A number of exercises based on the material covered.
