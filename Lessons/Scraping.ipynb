For instance, querying a database with a search term can be dynamic (the webpage will depend on the result), but you can make it static in some circumstances, by including the request in the URL, and fiddling with it (example <a href=\"https://recherche.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/?expert=2&q=Libert%C3%A9\">here</a>: see how you can manipulate the URL to get the required results, which are then static, or mostly so).)\n","\n","![](../Data/Images/Ariane.png)\n","\n","For instance, if you want to get the decisions of the Conseil d'Etat from Ariane, you need to click on at list two buttons. Once you do this, the URL does not budge - this is not a new page loading, but a truly dynamic webpage reacting to your input by producing (server-side) a new output, incorporated in the original website's framework. If we try to get it with requests, you can't get the`table` element from the webpage.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"id":"VIzU4NkiLKmI","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1696937757811,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":2263,"user":{"displayName":"Damien Charlotin","userId":"18070545951167915056"}},"outputId":"692a1178-2ce6-4bf1-eff1-85fb221ce429"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["\n","  <style>\n","    pre {\n","        white-space: pre-wrap;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","  "]},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["\n","  <style>\n","    pre {\n","        white-space: pre-wrap;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","  "]},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["None\n"]}],"source":["webpage = requests.get(\"https://www.conseil-etat.fr/arianeweb/#/recherche\")\n","# We try to get the conseil d'Etat research page\n","soup = BeautifulSoup(webpage.content)  # We create a soup element on that basis\n","\n","table = soup.find(\"table\")  # We look for the table with documents to download\n","print(table)  # Uh oh"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"btGSiQoRLKmI"},"source":["Instead we will use `Selenium`, a package made for this: Selenium will take control of a browser, and allow your script to perform just as much as you do.\n","\n","![](../Data/Images/Selenium.png)\n","\n","The main steps are however the same as for scraping with `requests`: you'll need to know how to get to your results, and tell the robot/webdriver as much, before collecting the page source and parsing it with BeautifulSoup.\n","\n","One difference here, is that instead of looking only for elements in HTML (put into a soup) and collect the data, you now need to interact with these elements - for instance, clicking.
