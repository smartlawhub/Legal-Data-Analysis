Variables and data persist as long as you don't restart the console or leave a Colab page. Remember to regularly save your data and code, as it won't stay in memory indefinitely.</li>\n","    \n","  <li><b>Comments</b>: These are non-executable notes within your code, used to describe or explain what's happening. Comments in Python start with the hashtag <code>#</code>.</li>\n","  \n","  <li><b>Errors</b>: Occur when trying to run invalid code. Common errors include:\n","      <ol>\n","          <li><i>Syntax Error</i>: Caused by incorrect code structure, vital to avoid in Python.</li>\n","          <li><i>Type Error</i>: Results from trying to combine incompatible data types.</li>\n","      </ol>\n","  </li>\n","  \n","  <li><b>PyCharm</b>: An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that enhances the coding experience. It color-codes different parts of your code and provides an integrated console. Useful shortcuts include:\n","      <ol>\n","          <li><i>Up Arrow</i>: When in the console, recalls previous inputs in reverse chronological order.</li>\n","          <li><i>Tab Key</i>: Autofills your code or displays a menu of options.</li>\n","          <li><i>Alt+Shift+E</i> (Windows - may differ on Mac): Executes highlighted code from a .py script.</li>\n","      </ol>\n","  </li>\n","  \n","  <li><b>Colab</b>: A cloud-based coding platform powered by Google. Unlike local coding, which uses your computer's resources, Colab runs on external servers. It's ideal for tasks requiring high computational power, but it has certain restrictions on data processing and package compatibility. For example, Colab might not be the best choice for web scraping tasks.</li>\n","</ul>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Otq5tWYP9bhO"},"source":["<b>1. </b>Computer code, at its most basic, calculates stuff.
