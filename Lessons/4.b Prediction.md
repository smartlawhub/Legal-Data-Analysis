# Prediction

<b>1. </b> Machine learning prediction is not that hard - at least if you want to get quick results. Customisation 
(to your type of data) is what takes time, which sometimes is not worth it. (Sometimes that time would be better 
spent acquiring more data, as this is a chief input for most machine learning applications.)

<b>2. </b>We'll perform a basic machine learning regression over Cour de cassation judgments, and see if, given a 
moyen, we are able to predict the result (cassation or rejet).

After executing all the associated code, you'll see that yes: our (very basic, even dumb) application of machine 
learning works in predicting cassation judgments. But now is time for a few caveats, namely:

<ul><li><b>Size</b> How big your dataset is is super important, and 800-odd judgments is not great in that regard;</li>
<li><b>Distribution</b> In front of <i>any</i> issue of phenomenon, this should be your first question: "what is the 
distribution". You might discover that surprising things are not so surprising put in context; here, it might be 
relevant to our problem that our dataset was already skewed with 64% cassation compared to rejets; and</li>
<li><b>Model</b> Different models might lead to different results, sometimes better, sometimes not, and you 
should make sure to try a few.</li></ul>
