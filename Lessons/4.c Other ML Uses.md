# Other ML Uses

<b>1. </b> Clustering and predictions are far from the only things we can do with Machine Learning tools and methods.

Another nice use case is outlier detection in a text corpus: given a general way of framing things (say, a dataset 
of laws on the same subject), can we detect outliers or anomalies (for instance, a provision that is unique to a law)
? The idea in the code attached is to use a neural network to "auto-encode" some data points: find a function that, 
from a limited version of the dataset (i.e., fewer dimensions) manages to recreate the dataset nonetheless. 

Then you can compare between your existing dimension and the predicted one. A high discrepancy for a given data point would  
indicate an outlier: the neural network was not able, given the structure of the entire data, to recreate that data 
point. We can use it over BIT clauses, and identify the year (or the treaty) with the most outliers on average for 
each cluster. (Which presupposes the clusters are correct.)

<b>2. </b> Another neat implementation of machine learning, along the same logic, is to obtain "topics".
