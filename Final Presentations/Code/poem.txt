The Frivolous Cake
1.1  A freckled and frivolous cake there was
1.1  That sailed upon a pointless sea, 
1.2  Or any lugubrious lake there was
1.3  In a manner emphatic and free.
1.4  How jointlessly, and how jointlessly
1.5  The frivolous cake sailed by
1.6  On the waves of the ocean that pointlessly
1.7  Threw fish to the lilac sky.

2.1  Oh, plenty and plenty of hake there was
2.1  Of a glory beyond compare, 
2.2  And every conceivable make there was
2.3  Was tossed through the lilac air.

3.1  Up the smooth billows and over the crests
3.1  Of the cumbersome combers flew
3.2  The frivolous cake with a knife in the wake
3.3  Of herself and her curranty crew.
3.4  Like a swordfish grim it would bounce and skim
3.5  (This dinner knife fierce and blue) , 
3.6  And the frivolous cake was filled to the brim
3.7  With the fun of her curranty crew.

4.1  Oh, plenty and plenty of hake there was
4.1  Of a glory beyond compare -
4.2  And every conceivable make there was
4.3  Was tossed through the lilac air.

5.1  Around the shores of the Elegant Isles
5.1  Where the cat-fish bask and purr
5.2  And lick their paws with adhesive smiles
5.3  And wriggle their fins of fur, 
5.4  They fly and fly ‘neath the lilac sky -
5.5  The frivolous cake, and the knife
5.6  Who winketh his glamorous indigo eye
5.7  In the wake of his future wife.

6.1  The crumbs blow free down the pointless sea
6.1  To the beat of a cakey heart
6.2  And the sensitive steel of the knife can feel
6.3  That love is a race apart
6.4  In the speed of the lingering light are blown
6.5  The crumbs to the hake above, 
6.6  And the tropical air vibrates to the drone
6.7  Of a cake in the throes of love.
