# Synthetise Data

<b.>1. </b>Your analyses will be more powerful if you are able to synthetise the data in the dataset.

For instance, when you look at the different results recorded in 
the `Sens et motivation` column, you can see that the categories are not super helpful. It'd be better to group them 
in two categories: favourable, and unfavourable (counting instances of "Incomp√©tent", "Inexistant", etc. as 
unfavourable).

We might also want to group the different sorts of administrations, but this is harder, as they are many more 
categories. We can do a process of iterating through these until most have been tagged one way or another, and be 
happy with leaving the "Other" on the side.

<u>Exercise 2</u> Improve the `dict` until the category "Other" in the column `Admin` has fewer than 90 entries. You 
well need to use regex in particular to get there.
