# Plots and Analyses

<b>1. </b>Now, once we have done all this, we can check one of the first questions we had: does the CADA slows down 
before elections take place ? One way to look at it is simply to plot the number of decisions, and indicate the relevant 
election (Presidentielle for the Central administration, etc.) with a line.

This is where the module `pyplot` becomes useful and relevant. Shortly put, while `pandas` allows you to make basic 
plots, you often need other modules to fine-tune those plots.
